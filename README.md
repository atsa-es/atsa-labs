## Installing bookdown and atsalibrary
[back to top](#installing-bookdown)

    ```
    library(devtools)
    install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
    install_github("nwfsc-timeseries/atsalibrary")
    ```
Note Windows users may need to run:
    ```
    Sys.setenv("R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS" = "true")
    ```

To see the 'Build Book' option on the build tab, go Tools:Project Options:Build Tools and set the project type to 'Website'.  

[Building a book](#build-the-book) Note, if you build the whole book, everything needs to be able to run.  That means you need STAN, JAGS, and all the requisite packages installed.  If you just want to update one chapter, then see the section on that.

[Build a chapter](#build-a-chapter) If you just want to work on one chapter or you making a fix to a chapter, go to this section.

Make sure to look at the section on the .gitignore file since bookdown produces a lot of extra files that you will not want on the AFTSLabbook GitHub site.

## Getting started editing a chapter
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

There are many pieces to a bookdown book and this README covers all the pieces.  It also covers some markdown special to bookdown cross-references and some conventions to keep our chapters in the same format in [Notes on writing the rmarkdown files](#writing-the-rmarkdown-files).

Here is the quick start version.

* **Where are the Rmd files for my chapter?**  They are in the folders with prefix "Lab-"
* **There are few Rmd files there.  Which are used?** The file ``_bookdown.yml`` specifies which Rmd are used in the book.  The file specifies ``cleanedRmd/`` is made from your Rmd file by the code ``cleanDefsinRmd.R``.  You'll need to run that on your file after your finish your Rmd work.
* **How do I just work on my chapter?** Edit a Rmd file as usual but use one of those in the "Lab-" folders as a template.
* **But I cloned the whole repo.  Can I use 'Build Book' in RStudio?**  Well, yes but it takes a long time to build the whole book.  Here's how to do just your chapter.  
    * Set your working directory to be your folder like 'Lab-fitting-DLMs'
    * Edit your Rmd, like DLM.Rmd
    * Click **knit**.  Ignore 'Build Book' in the Build tab.  
    * knit will put the html files in your folder and you'll need to clean up later.  The mathdefs won't be replaced and you won't have a bibliography.  If that bugs you, put this yaml at the top of your Rmd
    ```
    ---
    output: 
      html_document:
        includes:
          before_body: [../tex/bracket-start.txt, ../tex/defs.tex, ../tex/bracket-end.txt]
    bibliography: ../tex/Fish507.bib
    ---
    ```
    If you want to leave it there then you'll need to make a tex folder in your Lab- directory and copy mathdef.tex and Fish507.bib there.  Then get rid of the '../' in the file paths above.  The reason is that bookdown will detect this yaml and it is working from a directory above.  It won't find '../tex/'.
    
    bookdown documentation suggests that this should work
    ```bookdown::render_book( c("index.Rmd","cleanedRmd/basic-matrix-math.Rmd"), preview=TRUE)```
    but I have not been able to get that to work and it puts garbage in the docs folder.
* **How do I cite?**  The Fish507.bib file is in the folder "tex". Add bib citations there but search to make sure it is not already there.  "Lab-fitting-DLMs/DLM.Rmd" has examples of citations. Basically `\citet{ref}` becomes `@ref` and `\citep{ref}` becomes `[@ref]`.
* **Don't make changes to the docs folder.** That's were bookdown puts the website files and your changes will get wiped out.

## Style sheet
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

Use the style sheet to change the look of the book.  Change it in the top level.  Note, when bookdown builds the docs folder, it wipes out the folder, and copies stuff from the top-level into docs.  But if you are testing the style sheet, then make the change in docs.  Just make sure to copy over to the top-level or you'll lose the changes next time the book is built.

If you are having trouble with vertical spacing, then

* Make sure you have a blank line between your list elements.  Otherwise, the text won't be wrapped in <p> and it mucks with the spacing.

* Take a look at the style sheet and the spacing elements.  

## Writing the rmarkdown files
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

### Code in text, package names and object names

Use ```foo``` (or ``foo``) for things you want in code font.  The following should be put font: anything you would see in the R console.  Typically, this is code snippets or references to an output value, like ```foo```.  But also use it for anything that you would see in the console.  So if you want to tell the reader what the residual variance is in the ``lm()`` summary output, use ``sigma2``.

functions: The function ```lm()``` is used for linear regression.  Put ``()`` after functions.

Packages: Put in bold face.  **stats** package.

Object names: Put in bold face.  This is a **ts** object.

### Code output in text

If you want the output of code, then decide if you want that output in code font or not.  ```r 1+1``` and ``r 1+1`` will put 2 in code font. `r 1+1` will put 2 in the font of the text.

### Math shortcuts

You can use the shortcuts in tex/defs.tex.  These are things like \AA for ``\mathbf{A}``.  Note that for html, this is processed with mathJax.  For inline, mathJax looks a bit meh.  

We might think of only using \AA in equations and using ``**A**`` in text.  The downside is that it is easy for our text font to not match our font in our equations, which is determined by mathJax.

### Label chunks uniquely with a unique tag for your chapter

Label all your chunks uniquely and do NOT use "." or ":" in your chunk names. "-" is ok.  This is because bookdown will sometimes make filenames from this name and ":" and "." are illegal in filenames.
So ``foo-foo`` is ok and ``foo.foo`` is not

### Chapter and section labelling

Label chapters like with 'chap-' and a tag specific to that chapter

    # This is chapter foo {#chap-foo}

Label sections like with 'sec-' and a tag specific to that chapter

    # This is section foo {#sec-foo-this-section}

### Cross-references

The cross-references all take the form `\@ref(label)`.

Chapters and sections: 

{#sec-ts-CO2-data}  --> Section`\@ref(sec-ts-CO2-data)`

{#chap-ts}  --> Chapter `\@ref(chap-ts)` 

Figures and figures:  Bookdown builds the figure label from the chunk label.

```{r ts-fig-foo}plot(1)``` --> Figure \@ref{fig:ts-fig-foo}

```{r ts-table-foo}kable(1)``` --> Table \@ref{tab:ts-fig-foo}

If you don't use kable(), then read up on table cross-referencing
https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/tables.html

Equations: You must use the form 'eq:label' so an equation reference in the text looks like `\@ref(eq:label)`

To have an equation number that you can reference you need to label the equation.  To do this, you must use the equation, align or gather environments.

```
\begin{equation}
1+1
(\#eq:one)
\end{equation}
```

### Figure captions

You can pass these in `fig.cap='This is my caption.'` but if your caption is long or contains rmarkdown (or latex), then use a text reference. Here is an example

    (ref:foo) This is a caption with **markdown**, ``code`` and some $\beta$ greek in latex. 

    ```{r foo, fig.cap='(ref:foo)'}
    plot(cars)  # a scatterplot
    ```

### R code you don't want put in the R scripts for users

`cleanDefsinRmd.R` will make R code files automatically from the Rmd files.  If you have chunks that you don't want in those files put `purl=FALSE` in the header.  So
```{r foo, purl=FALSE}
```

### Lists notes

Use indenting to make sure the paragraphs in your lists (esp. in the Problems sections) all line up.
```
1. Level 1
   
    Paragraph in Level 1
        
    a. another list within level 1
    b. another list within level 1
````
Use a blank space between your lists.  The html is different and your list spacing will vary if you are not consistent.  The html for this
```
* foo1
* foo2
```
Is different than
```
* foo1

* foo2
```

### Citations

The bib file is Fish507.bib in the tex folder.

``[@Lamonetal1998; @ScheuerellWilliams2005]`` gets you (Lamon et al. 1998; Scheuerell and Williams 2006).

``@Lamonetal1998`` gets Lamon et al. (1998)


## Special conventions
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

Look at the other Rmd files and follow the conventions for the first page.  These have

* A link to the R code for the chapter in docs/Rcode folder.
* A section about the packages and data.  If short, this can be on page 1 of chapter.  If long, a separate section.
* Data should be put in the **atsalibrary** package and loaded from there.

At the top of the Rmd files, add a hidden chunk that sets the tag if you forget to label a chunk.  You cannot duplicate chunk names across all Rmd files, so the tag makes sure that doesn't happen.

    ```{r dfa-setup, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
    #in case you forget to add a chunk label
    knitr::opts_knit$set(unnamed.chunk.label = "dfa-")
    ```
## Required packages
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

* knitr, bookdown, formatR, rmarkdown
* rjags, r2jags, coda, and install JAGS
* rstan
* forecast
* MARSS
* RcppEigen
* atsalibrary

## Build the book
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

Do you need re-run any cached code blocks?

Yes? Run

    ```{r tmp, eval=FALSE}
    source("cleanDefsinRmd.R")
    ```
Then delete anything in _bookdown_files folder and then use Build Book in the Build tab. This will take awhile.

No? Run

    ```{r tmp, eval=FALSE}
    source("cleanDefsinRmd.R")
    bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")
    bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book")
    ```
Note this code will fail if _bookdown_files folder or any cache files do not exist.  In that case, use 'Build Book' in RStudio. If any code to be cached is changed or created, 'Build Book' must be used to remake the cache.  Takes a long time since all the cache is rebuilt.  Always rerun 'cleanDefsinRmd.R' before using 'Build Book'.  Note that build book to pdf will fail if there are \newcommands in the Rmd files.  That's ok.  Cache will still be built and then run `render_book`.  You can select the arrow next to 'Build Book' and just use build to gitbook.

You can use 'Build Book' under the build tab in RStudio but make sure to run `source("cleanDefsinRmd.R")` first.  To see the 'Build Book' option on the build tab, go Tools:Project Options:Build Tools and set the project type to 'Website'.

**Common problems** If build fails, there will be junk left over labeled "Applied_Time_Series_Analysis". All that needs to be deleted. Usually it is just an Rmd file but if you see other stuff (like cache folders), that needs to go also. The caching causes endless problems with book building especially if that gets updated in GitHub. So best if only one person builds and only on one machine. Build the whole book periodically or when ever there are code changes (as opposed to text only changes). Restart R before rebuilding. Typically `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")` works for awhile and builds fast, and then it doesn't work and you see errors and warnings about cache or rds files. Then it is time for a full rebuild. Check that `_bookdown_files` (the cache) is empty and do a full rebuild using Build Book tab.

## Build a chapter
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

If you are adding a chapter, then you will need to [re-build the whole book](#build-the-book) to get the index.html file updated.  But work on your chapter on its own until it is done.  Just knit the Rmd as described in [Getting started with editing your chapter](#getting-started) and when you are ready, build the whole book.

If you are working on an existing chapter and just making some updates without adding any sections, then you don't need to re-build the whole book.  You just need to update the docs/yourchap.html and figure pngs in docs/Applied_Time_Series_Analysis/figure_html/

**Making big changes to your chapter?** Then edit your Rmd in your ``Lab-`` folder.  Knit that Rmd until you are ready. Once that is ready, [re-build the whole book](#build-the-book).

**Making minor changes with no added sections?** Then edit your Rmd in your ``Lab-`` folder AND make the same edits to the Rmd in the cleanedRmd folder.  Then knit the Rmd in the cleanedRmd folder. You'll need to move the files to the right places.

**Making really minor changes?** Then edit your Rmd in your ``Lab-`` folder AND make the same edits to the html in the docs folder.  No need to knit anything.  You are changing the Rmd so that your changes are not wiped out when the whole book is rebuilt later.


## Key files
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

* index.Rmd: First page.  Yaml metadata for the book is at the top of file
* _output.yml output yaml is here
* _bookdown.yml has what Rmd to put in the book.  rmd_subdir: TRUE means to allow search across chapters
* style.css is the css file for the book.  Sets things like font and code block style.
* DESCRIPTION RStudio uses this to detect that this is a bookdown book.  
* cleanDefsinRmd.R This is the script to populate the cleanedRmd folder with the Rmd files used in _bookdown.yml.  It replaces the mathdefs (like \AA), tangles the R code from the Rmd and puts in docs/Rcode.

## Directories
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

Most of these you will see on GitHub.  A couple directories are only for your local machine.

### docs

This is where bookdown puts the html files.  It also has an Rcode and data folders.  `cleanDefsinRmd()` tangles the Rmds and put the R scripts in the Rcode folder.  You need to put your data files in the data folder so that the user can download them.  See the Rmd file for intro-ts-funcs.Rmd for an example.

### individual chapter folders

This is were your Rmd files for the chapter are kept.  `cleanDefsinRmd()` takes these, cleans and puts a copy in the cleanedRmd folder.  You need to edit cleanDefsinRmd.R, when you add new Rmd files to be added to the book.

### images

This has cover image though not used anywhere (yet).

### tex

This has tex files used for the PDF production.

### _bookdown_files (local machine only)

bookdown populates this.  It has the cache.  You don't want this on GitHub.

### libs (local machine only)

To build the book on your local machine, you'll install the bookdown package and build as described in [build the book](#build).  bookdown will create the libs folder in your project with jquery and gitbook folders.

## gitignore file
[back to top](#afts-labbook-info)

I have many files in my local repository that don't need to be on GitHub.  If a book build fails, the clean up fails so you will have a lot of extra directories and files in your base directory.  Normally, if build does not fail, bookdown moves this to the docs folder.  The `#Misc` stuff is stuff I am working on and have not been cleaned up yet.

Here is what my .gitignore looks like on my mac:

Here is what my .gitignore looks like on my PC. `Applied_Time_Series_Analysis_cache` is created by create pdf (then deleted) and `_bookdown_files` created by Build Book (and not deleted).
