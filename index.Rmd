# Preface {-}

```{r RUNFIRST, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment=NA, cache=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60), tidy=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%')
```

This is material that was developed as part of a course we teach at the University of Washington on applied time series analysis for fisheries and environmental data.  You can find our lectures on our course website [ATSA](https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa/).

### Book package {-}

The book uses a number of R packages and a variety of fisheries data sets.  The packages and data sets can be installed by installing our  **atsalibrary** package which is hosted on GitHub:

```{r preface-load-atsa, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("nwfsc-timeseries/atsalibrary")
```

### Authors {-}

The authors are research scientists at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC).  This work was conducted as part of our jobs at the NWFSC, a research center for NOAA Fisheries which is a United States federal government agency.
