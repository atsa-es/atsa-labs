\chaptermark{Introduction to time series}

## What is a time series?

At a very basic level, a time series is a set of observations taken sequentially in time. It is different than non-temporal data because each data point has an order and is, typically, related to the data points before and after by some process.

![](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2_data_mlo.png)

A ts can be represented as a set

$$
\{ x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n \} 
$$

For example,
$$
\{ 10,31,27,42,53,15 \}
$$

## Examples of time series

```{r ex_ts_plot_www, fig.cap = "Number of users connected to the internet"}
data(WWWusage)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(WWWusage, ylab = "", las = 1, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

```{r ex_ts_plot_lynx, fig.cap = "Number of lynx trapped in Canada from 1821-1934"}
data(lynx)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(lynx, ylab = "", las = 1, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```


## Classification of time series | By some _index set_

Interval across real time; $x(t)$    

* begin/end: $t \in [1.1,2.5]$    

Discrete time; $x_t$    

* Equally spaced: $t = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$  
* Equally spaced w/ missing value: $t = \{1,2,4,5,6\}$  
* Unequally spaced: $t = \{2,3,4,6,9\}$  


## Classification of time series | By the _underlying process_    

Discrete (eg, total # of fish caught per trawl)

Continuous (eg, salinity, temperature)


## Classification of time series | By the _number of values recorded_    

Univariate/scalar (eg, total # of fish caught)    

Multivariate/vector (eg, # of each spp of fish caught)


## Classification of time series | By the _type of values recorded_    

Integer (eg, # of fish in 5 min trawl = 2413)

Rational (eg, fraction of unclipped fish = 47/951)

Real (eg, fish mass = 10.2 g)

Complex (eg, cos(2π2.43) + _i_ sin(2π2.43))


## Statistical analyses of time series

Most statistical analyses are concerned with estimating properties of a population from a sample.  For example, we use fish caught in a seine to infer the mean size of fish in a lake.  Time series analysis, however, presents a different situation:

* Although we could vary the _length_ of an observed time series, it is often impossible to make multiple observations at a _given_ point in time

For example, one can’t observe today’s closing price of Microsoft stock more than once. Thus, conventional statistical procedures, based on large sample estimates, are inappropriate.

```{r load-quantmod}
if (!require("quantmod")) {
    install.packages("quantmod")
    library(quantmod)
}
start <- as.Date("2016-01-01")
end <- as.Date("2016-10-01")
getSymbols("MSFT", src = "yahoo", from = start, to = end)
plot(MSFT[, "MSFT.Close"], main = "MSFT")
```

We use a time series model to analyze time series data.

## What is a time series model?

A _time series model_ for $\{x_t\}$ is a specification of the joint distributions of a sequence of random variables $\{X_t\}$, of which $\{x_t\}$ is thought to be a realization.  

Here is a plot of many realizations from a time series model.

```{r ex_ts_plot_joint_dist, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
nn <- 50
tt <- 40
ww <- matrix(rnorm(nn*tt), tt, nn)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
matplot(ww, type="l", lty="solid",  las = 1,
        ylab = expression(italic(X[t])), xlab = "Time",
        col = gray(0.5, 0.4))
```

These lines represent the distribution of possible realizations.  However, we have only one realization.

```{r ex_ts_plot_joint_dist_2, echo=FALSE}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
matplot(ww, type="l", lty="solid",  las = 1,
        ylab = expression(italic(X[t])), xlab = "Time",
        col = gray(0.5, 0.4))
lines(ww[,1], col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```


## Two simple and classic time series models

White noise: $x_t \sim N(0,1)$

```{r ex_WN}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
matplot(ww, type="l", lty="solid",  las = 1,
        ylab = expression(italic(x[t])), xlab = "Time",
        col = gray(0.5, 0.4))
```

Random walk: $x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t,~\text{with}~w_t \sim N(0,1)$

```{r ex_RW}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
matplot(apply(ww, 2, cumsum), type="l", lty="solid",  las = 1,
        ylab = expression(italic(x[t])), xlab = "Time",
        col = gray(0.5, 0.4))
```


## Classical decomposition

### Model time series $\{x_t\}$ as a combination of

1. trend ($m_t$)  
2. seasonal component ($s_t$)  
3. remainder ($e_t$)

$x_t = m_t + s_t + e_t$


## Classical decomposition | 1. The trend ($m_t$)

We need a way to extract the so-called _signal_.  One common method is via "linear filters"

$$
m_t = \sum_{i=-\infty}^{\infty} \lambda_i x_{t+1}
$$

For example, a moving average

$$
m_t = \sum_{i=-a}^{a} \frac{1}{2a + 1} x_{t+i}
$$

If $a = 1$, then

$$
m_t = \frac{1}{3}(x_{t-1} + x_t + x_{t+1})
$$


## Example of linear filtering

Here is a time series.

```{r plot_airpass, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
xx <- AirPassengers
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(xx, las = 1, ylab = "")
```

A linear filter with $a=3$ closely tracks the data.

```{r plot_airpass_fltr1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(xx, las = 1, ylab = "")
## weights for moving avg
fltr <- c(1,1,1)/3
trend <- filter(xx, filter=fltr, method="convo", sides=2)
lines(trend, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE),
     labels = expression(paste(lambda, " = 1/3")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "blue")
```

As we increase the length of data that is averaged from 1 on each side ($a=3$) to 4 on each side ($a=9$), the trend line is smoother.

```{r plot_airpass_fltr2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(xx, las = 1, ylab = "")
## weights for moving avg
fltr2 <- rep(1,9)/9
trend2 <- filter(xx, filter=fltr2, method="convo", sides=2)
lines(trend, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
lines(trend2, col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE),
     labels = expression(paste(lambda, " = 1/3")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "blue")
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE)*0.9,
     labels = expression(paste(lambda, " = 1/9")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "darkorange")
```

When we increase up to 13 points on each side ($a=27$), the trend line is very smooth.

```{r plot_airpass_fltr3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(xx, las = 1, ylab = "")
## weights for moving avg
fltr3 <- rep(1,27)/27
trend3 <- filter(xx, filter=fltr3, method="convo", sides=2)
lines(trend, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
lines(trend2, col = "darkorange", lwd = 2)
lines(trend3, col = "darkred", lwd = 2)
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE),
     labels = expression(paste(lambda, " = 1/3")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "blue")
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE)*0.9,
     labels = expression(paste(lambda, " = 1/9")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "darkorange")
text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE)*0.8,
     labels = expression(paste(lambda, " = 1/27")),
     adj = c(0,0), col = "darkred")
```


## Classical decomposition | 2. Seasonal effect ($s_t$)

Once we have an estimate of the trend $m_t$, we can estimate $s_t$ simply by subtraction:

$$
s_t = x_t - m_t
$$

```{r plot_airpass_decomp_seas, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = ""}
seas <- trend2 - xx
  
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(seas, las = 1, ylab = "")
# text(x = 1949, y = max(trend, na.rm = TRUE)*0.9,
#      labels = expression(paste(lambda, " = 1/9")),
#      adj = c(0,0), col = "darkorange")
```

This is the seasonal effect ($s_t$), assuming $\lambda = 1/9$, 
but, $s_t$ includes the remainder $e_t$ as well.  Instead we can estimate the mean seasonal effect ($s_t$).

```{r mean_seasonal_effects}
seas_2 <- decompose(xx)$seasonal
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(seas_2, las = 1, ylab = "")
```


## Classical decomposition | 3. Remainder ($e_t$)

Now we can estimate $e_t$ via subtraction:

$$
e_t = x_t - m_t - s_t
$$


```{r errors}
ee <- decompose(xx)$random
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(ee, las = 1, ylab = "")
```

## Log-transformed data

Let's repeat the decomposition with the log of the airline data.

```{r plot_ln_airpass, fig.cap = "Log monthly airline passengers from 1949-1960"}
lx <- log(AirPassengers)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(lx, las = 1, ylab = "")
```

### The trend ($m_t$)

```{r plot_lin_trend, echo=FALSE}
tt <- as.vector(time(xx))
cc <- coef(lm(lx ~ tt))
pp <- cc[1] + cc[2] * tt
  
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot(tt, lx, type="l", las = 1,
     xlab = "Time", ylab = "")
lines(tt, pp, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

### Seasonal effect ($s_t$) with error ($e_t$)

```{r seas_ln_dat, echo=FALSE}
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(lx-pp)
```

### Mean seasonal effect ($s_t$)

```{r mean_seas_effects, echo=FALSE}
## length of ts
ll <- length(lx)
## frequency (ie, 12)
ff <- frequency(lx)
## number of periods (years); %/% is integer division
periods <- ll %/% ff
## index of cumulative month
index <- seq(1,ll,by=ff) - 1
## get mean by month
mm <- numeric(ff)
for(i in 1:ff) {
  mm[i] <- mean(lx[index+i], na.rm=TRUE)
}
## subtract mean to make overall mean=0
mm <- mm - mean(mm)
seas_2 <- ts(rep(mm, periods+1)[seq(ll)],
               start=start(lx), 
               frequency=ff)
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(seas_2, las = 1, ylab = "")
```

### Remainder ($e_t$)

```{r ln_errors}
le <- lx - pp - seas_2
par(mai = c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1), omi = c(0,0,0,0))
plot.ts(le, las = 1, ylab = "")
```
