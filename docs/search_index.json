If you haven’t done it in awhile, google `matrix multiplication youtube’ and you find lots of 5min videos to remind you. In R, you use the %*% operation to do matrix multiplication. When you do matrix multiplication, the columns of the matrix on the left must equal the rows of the matrix on the right. The result is a matrix that has the number of rows of the matrix on the left and number of columns of the matrix on the right. \\[(n \\times m)(m \\times p) = (n \\times p)\\] A=matrix(1:6, 2, 3) #2 rows, 3 columns B=matrix(1:6, 3, 2) #3 rows, 2 columns A%*%B #this works [,1] [,2] [1,] 22 49 [2,] 28 64 B%*%A #this works [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 9 19 29 [2,] 12 26 40 [3,] 15 33 51 try(B%*%B) #this doesn&#39;t Error in B %*% B : non-conformable arguments To add two matrices use +.

It looks exactly like what is in our model written in matrix form (Equation (2.5)). 2.2.3 When does Form 1 arise? This form of writing a regression model will come up when you work with dynamic linear models (DLMs). With DLMs, you will be fitting models of the form \\(\\mathbf{y}_t=\\mathbf{Z}_t\\mathbf{x}_t+\\mathbf{e}_t\\). In these models you have multiple \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) at regular time points and you allow your regression parameters, the \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), to evolve through time as a random walk. 2.2.4 Matrix Form 1b: The transpose of Form 1 We could also write Form 1 as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.6} \\begin{split} \\begin{bmatrix}stack.loss_1&amp;stack.loss_2&amp;stack.loss_3 &amp;stack.loss_4\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\ \\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha&amp; \\beta_1 &amp; \\beta_2 &amp; \\beta_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1\\\\air_1&amp;air_2&amp;air_3&amp;air_4\\\\wind_1&amp;wind_2&amp;wind_3&amp;wind_4\\\\acid_1&amp;acid_2&amp;acid_3&amp;acid_4\\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}e_1&amp;e_2&amp;e_3&amp;e_4\\end{bmatrix} \\end{split} \\end{equation}\\] This is just the transpose of Form 1. Work through the matrix algebra to make sure you understand why Equation (2.6) is Equation (2.1) for all the \\(i\\) data points together and why it is equal to the transpose of Equation (2.2). You’ll need the relationship \\((\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})^\\top=\\mathbf{B}^\\top \\mathbf{A}^\\top\\). Let’s write Equation (2.6) as \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{d}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) contains our parameters. Then we can solve for \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) following the steps in Section 2.2.1 but multiplying from the right instead of from the left. Work through the steps to show that \\(\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{y}\\mathbf{d}^\\top(\\mathbf{d}\\mathbf{d}^\\top)^{-1}\\). y=matrix(dat$stack.loss, nrow=1) d=rbind(1, dat$Air.Flow, dat$Water.Temp, dat$Acid.Conc) y%*%t(d)%*%solve(d%*%t(d)) [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] -524.9048 -1.047619 7.619048 5 coef(fit1.mult) (Intercept) Air.Flow Water.Temp Acid.Conc. -524.904762 -1.047619 7.619048 5.000000 "],
["sec-mlr-form2.html", "2.3 Matrix Form 2", " 2.3 Matrix Form 2 In this form, we have the explanatory variables in a matrix on the right of our parameter matrix as in Form 1b but we arrange everything a little differently: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.7} \\begin{bmatrix}stack.loss_1\\\\stack.loss_2\\\\stack.loss_3\\\\stack.loss_4\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha&amp;\\beta&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ \\alpha&amp;0&amp;\\beta&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ \\alpha&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta&amp;0\\\\ \\alpha&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\air_1\\\\air_2\\\\air_3\\\\air_4\\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}e_1\\\\e_2\\\\e_3\\\\e_4\\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] Work through the matrix algebra to make sure you understand why Equation (2.7) is the same as Equation (2.1) for all the \\(i\\) data points together. We will write Form 2 succinctly as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.8} \\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{e} \\end{equation}\\] 2.3.1 Form 2 with multiple explanatory variables The \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a column vector of the explanatory variables. If we have more explanatory variables, we add them to the column vector at the bottom. So if we had air flow, water temperature and acid concentration as explanatory variables, \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) looks like \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.9} \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ air_1 \\\\ air_2 \\\\ air_3 \\\\ air_4 \\\\ water_1 \\\\ water_2 \\\\ water_3 \\\\ water_4 \\\\ acid_1 \\\\ acid_2 \\\\ acid_3 \\\\ acid_4 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] Add columns to the \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) matrix for each new variable. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha &amp; \\beta_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\beta_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\beta_3 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ \\alpha &amp; 0 &amp; \\beta_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\beta_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\beta_3 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ \\alpha&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta_1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta_2&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta_3&amp;0\\\\ \\alpha&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta_1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta_2&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta_3 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] The number of rows of \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is always \\(n\\), the number of rows of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\), because the number of rows on the left and right of the equal sign must match. The number of columns in \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is determined by the size of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). If there is an intercept, there is a 1 in \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). Then each explanatory variable (like air flow and wind) appears \\(n\\) times. So if the number of explanatory variables is \\(k\\), the number of columns in \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is \\(1+k \\times n\\) if there is an intercept term and \\(k \\times n\\) if there is not. 2.3.2 When does Form 2 arise? Form 2 is similar to how multivariate time series models are typically written for reading by humans (on a whiteboard or paper). In these models, we see equations like this: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.10} \\begin{bmatrix}y_1\\\\y_2\\\\y_3\\\\y_4\\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta_a&amp;\\beta_b\\\\ \\beta_a&amp;0.1\\\\ \\beta_b&amp;\\beta_a\\\\ 0&amp;\\beta_a \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix}_t + \\begin{bmatrix}e_1\\\\e_2\\\\e_3\\\\e_4\\end{bmatrix}_t \\end{equation}\\] In this case, \\(\\mathbf{y}_t\\) is the set of 4 observations at time \\(t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_t\\) is the set of 2 explanatory variables at time \\(t\\). The \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is showing how we are modeling the effects of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) on the \\(y\\)s. Notice that the effects are not consistent across the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This model would not be possible to fit with lm() but will be easy to fit with MARSS(). 2.3.3 Solving for the parameters for Form 2 To solve for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), we need our parameters in a column matrix like so \\(\\left[ \\begin{smallmatrix}\\alpha\\\\\\beta\\end{smallmatrix} \\right]\\). We do this by rewritting \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x}\\) in Equation (2.8) in `vec’ form: if \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is a \\(n \\times m\\) matrix and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a matrix with 1 column and \\(m\\) rows, then \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x} = (\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\otimes \\mathbf{I}_n)\\,\\text{vec}(\\mathbf{Z})\\). The symbol \\(\\otimes\\) means Kronecker product and just ignore it since you’ll never see it again in our course (or google ‘kronecker product’ if you are curious). The “vec” of a matrix is that matrix rearranged as a single column: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\,\\text{vec} \\begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;2\\\\ 3&amp;4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\3\\\\2\\\\4 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation*}\\] Notice how you just take each column one by one and stack them under each other. In R, the vec is A=matrix(1:6,nrow=2,byrow=TRUE) vecA = matrix(A,ncol=1) \\(\\mathbf{I}_n\\) is a \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix, a diagonal matrix with all 0s on the off-diagonals and all 1s on the diagonal. In R, this is simply diag(n). To show how we solve for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), let’s use an example with only 3 data points so Equation (2.7) becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.11} \\begin{bmatrix}stack.loss_1\\\\stack.loss_2\\\\stack.loss_3\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha&amp;\\beta&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ \\alpha&amp;0&amp;\\beta&amp;0\\\\ \\alpha&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\air_1\\\\air_2\\\\air_3\\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}e_1\\\\e_2\\\\e_3\\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] Using \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x} = (\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\otimes \\mathbf{I}_n)\\,\\text{vec}(\\mathbf{Z})\\), this means \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha&amp;\\beta&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ \\alpha&amp;0&amp;\\beta&amp;0\\\\ \\alpha&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\beta \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\air_1\\\\air_2\\\\air_3\\end{bmatrix} =\\big(\\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;air_1&amp;air_2&amp; air_3\\end{bmatrix} \\otimes \\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;1&amp;0 \\\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1 \\end{bmatrix} \\bigr) \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha\\\\ \\alpha\\\\ \\alpha\\\\ \\beta\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ \\beta\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ \\beta \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] We need to rewrite the \\(\\,\\text{vec}(\\mathbf{Z})\\) as a `permutation’ matrix times \\(\\left[ \\begin{smallmatrix}\\alpha\\\\\\beta\\end{smallmatrix} \\right]\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha\\\\ \\alpha\\\\ \\alpha\\\\ \\beta\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ \\beta\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ \\beta \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;0\\\\ 1&amp;0\\\\ 1&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;1\\\\ 0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;1\\\\ 0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;0\\\\ 0&amp;1\\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha\\\\ \\beta \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{p} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) is the permutation matrix and \\(\\mathbf{p}=\\left[ \\begin{smallmatrix}\\alpha\\\\\\beta\\end{smallmatrix} \\right]\\). Thus, \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.12} \\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{e} = (\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\otimes \\mathbf{I}_n)\\mathbf{P}\\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha\\\\ \\beta\\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{p} + \\mathbf{e} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{M}=(\\mathbf{x}^\\top \\otimes \\mathbf{I}_n)\\mathbf{P}\\). We can solve for \\(\\mathbf{p}\\), the parameters, using \\[(\\mathbf{M}^\\top\\mathbf{M})^{-1}\\mathbf{M}^\\top\\mathbf{y}\\] as before. 2.3.4 Code to solve for parameters in Form 2 In the homework, you will use the R code in this section to solve for the parameters in Form 2. Later when you are fitting multivariate time series models, you will not solve for parameters this way but you will need to both construct \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) matrices in R and read \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) matrices. The homework will give you practice creating \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) matrices in R. #make your y and x matrices y=matrix(dat$stack.loss, ncol=1) x=matrix(c(1,dat$Air.Flow),ncol=1) #make the Z matrix n=nrow(dat) #number of rows in our data file k=1 #Z has n rows and 1 col for intercept, and n cols for the n air data points #a list matrix allows us to combine &quot;characters&quot; and numbers Z=matrix(list(0),n,k*n+1) Z[,1]=&quot;alpha&quot; diag(Z[1:n,1+1:n])=&quot;beta&quot; #this function creates that permutation matrix for you P=MARSS:::convert.model.mat(Z)$free[,,1] M=kronecker(t(x),diag(n))%*%P solve(t(M)%*%M)%*%t(M)%*%y [,1] alpha -11.6159170 beta 0.6412918 coef(lm(dat$stack.loss ~ dat$Air.Flow)) (Intercept) dat$Air.Flow -11.6159170 0.6412918 Go through this code line by line at the R command line. Look at Z. It is a list matrix that allows you to combine numbers (the 0s) with character string (names of parameters). Look at the permutation matrix P. Try MARSS:::convert.model.mat(Z)$free and see that it returns a 3D matrix, which is why the [,,1] appears (to get us a 2D matrix). To use more data points, you can redefine dat to say dat=stackloss to use all 21 data points. "],

The problem is two-fold. First by having both region and quarter intercepts, we created models where 2 intercepts appear for one \\(i\\) model and we cannot estimate both. lm() helps us out by setting one of the factor effects to 0. It will chose the first alphabetically. But as we saw with the model where odd numbered plants were north and even numbered were south, we can still have a situation where one of the intercepts is non-identifiable. lm() helps us out by alerting us to the problem by setting one to NA. Once you start developing your own models, you will need to make sure that all your parameters are identifiable. If they are not, your code will simply `chase its tail’. The code will generally take forever to converge or if you did not try different starting conditions, it may look like it converged but actually the estimates for the confounded parameters are meaningless. So you will need to think carefully about the model you are fitting and consider if there are multiple parameters measuring the same thing (for example 2 intercept parameters). "],

["sec-tslab-time-series-plots.html", "4.1 Time series plots", " 4.1 Time series plots Time series plots are an excellent way to begin the process of understanding what sort of process might have generated the data of interest. Traditionally, time series have been plotted with the observed data on the \\(y\\)-axis and time on the \\(x\\)-axis. Sequential time points are usually connected with some form of line, but sometimes other plot forms can be a useful way of conveying important information in the time series (e.g., barplots of sea-surface temperature anomolies show nicely the contrasting El Niño and La Niña phenomena). 4.1.1 ts objects and plot.ts() The CO\\(_2\\) data are stored in R as a data.frame object, but we would like to transform the class to a more user-friendly format for dealing with time series. Fortunately, the ts() function will do just that, and return an object of class ts as well. In addition to the data themselves, we need to provide ts() with 2 pieces of information about the time index for the data. The first, frequency, is a bit of a misnomer because it does not really refer to the number of cycles per unit time, but rather the number of observations/samples per cycle. So, for example, if the data were collected each hour of a day then frequency=24. The second, start, specifies the first sample in terms of (\\(day\\), \\(hour\\)), (\\(year\\), \\(month\\)), etc. So, for example, if the data were collected monthly beginning in November of 1969, then frequency=12 and start=c(1969,11). If the data were collected annually, then you simply specify start as a scalar (e.g., start=1991) and omit frequency (i.e., R will set frequency=1 by default). The Mauna Loa time series is collected monthly and begins in March of 1958, which we can get from the data themselves, and then pass to ts(). ## create a time series (ts) object from the CO2 data co2 &lt;- ts(data=CO2$ppm, frequency=12, start=c(CO2[1,&quot;year&quot;],CO2[1,&quot;month&quot;])) Now let’s plot the data using plot.ts(), which is designed specifically for ts objects like the one we just created above. It’s nice because we don’t need to specify any \\(x\\)-values as they are taken directly from the ts object. ## plot the ts plot.ts(co2, ylab=expression(paste(&quot;CO&quot;[2],&quot; (ppm)&quot;))) Figure 4.1: Time series of the atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i measured monthly from March 1958 to present. Examination of the plotted time series (Figure 4.1) shows 2 obvious features that would violate any assumption of stationarity: 1) an increasing (and perhaps non-linear) trend over time, and 2) strong seasonal patterns. (Aside: Do you know the causes of these 2 phenomena?) 4.1.2 Combining and plotting multiple ts objects Before we examine the CO\\(_2\\) data further, however, let’s see a quick example of how you can combine and plot multiple time series together. We’ll use the data on monthly mean temperature anomolies for the Northern Hemisphere (Temp). First convert Temp to a ts object. temp.ts &lt;- ts(data=Temp$Value, frequency=12, start=c(1880,1)) Before we can plot the two time series together, however, we need to line up their time indices because the temperature data start in January of 1880, but the CO\\(_2\\) data start in March of 1958. Fortunately, the ts.intersect() function makes this really easy once the data have been transformed to ts objects by trimming the data to a common time frame. Also, ts.union() works in a similar fashion, but it pads one or both series with the appropriate number of NA’s. Let’s try both. ## intersection (only overlapping times) datI &lt;- ts.intersect(co2,temp.ts) ## dimensions of common-time data dim(datI) [1] 682 2 ## union (all times) datU &lt;- ts.union(co2,temp.ts) ## dimensions of all-time data dim(datU) [1] 1647 2 As you can see, the intersection of the two data sets is much smaller than the union. If you compare them, you will see that the first 938 rows of datU contains NA in the co2 column. It turns out that the regular plot() function in R is smart enough to recognize a ts object and use the information contained therein appropriately. Here’s how to plot the intersection of the two time series together with the y-axes on alternate sides (results are shown in Figure 4.2): ## plot the ts plot(datI, main=&quot;&quot;, yax.flip=TRUE) Figure 4.2: Time series of the atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i (top) and the mean temperature index for the Northern Hemisphere (bottom) measured monthly from March 1958 to present.

["sec-tslab-decomposition-of-time-series.html", "4.2 Decomposition of time series", " 4.2 Decomposition of time series Plotting time series data is an important first step in analyzing their various components. Beyond that, however, we need a more formal means for identifying and removing characteristics such as a trend or seasonal variation. As discussed in lecture, the decomposition model reduces a time series into 3 components: trend, seasonal effects, and random errors. In turn, we aim to model the random errors as some form of stationary process. Let’s begin with a simple, additive decomposition model for a time series \\(x_t\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.1} x_t = m_t + s_t + e_t, \\end{equation}\\] where, at time \\(t\\), \\(m_t\\) is the trend, \\(s_t\\) is the seasonal effect, and \\(e_t\\) is a random error that we generally assume to have zero-mean and to be correlated over time. Thus, by estimating and subtracting both \\(\\{m_t\\}\\) and \\(\\{s_t\\}\\) from \\(\\{x_t\\}\\), we hope to have a time series of stationary residuals \\(\\{e_t\\}\\). 4.2.1 Estimating trends In lecture we discussed how linear filters are a common way to estimate trends in time series. One of the most common linear filters is the moving average, which for time lags from \\(-a\\) to \\(a\\) is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.2} \\hat{m}_t = \\sum_{k=-a}^{a} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+2a}\\right) x_{t+k}. \\end{equation}\\] This model works well for moving windows of odd-numbered lengths, but should be adjusted for even-numbered lengths by adding only \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the 2 most extreme lags so that the filtered value at time \\(t\\) lines up with the original observation at time \\(t\\). So, for example, in a case with monthly data such as the atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration where a 12-point moving average would be an obvious choice, the linear filter would be \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.3} \\hat{m}_t = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}x_{t-6} + x_{t-5} + \\dots + x_{t-1} + x_t + x_{t+1} + \\dots + x_{t+5} + \\frac{1}{2}x_{t+6}}{12} \\end{equation}\\] It is important to note here that our time series of the estimated trend \\(\\{\\hat{m}_t\\}\\) is actually shorter than the observed time series by \\(2a\\) units. Conveniently, R has the built-in function filter() for estimating moving-average (and other) linear filters. In addition to specifying the time series to be filtered, we need to pass in the filter weights (and 2 other arguments we won’t worry about here–type ?filter to get more information). The easiest way to create the filter is with the rep() function: ## weights for moving avg fltr &lt;- c(1/2,rep(1,times=11),1/2)/12 Now let’s get our estimate of the trend \\(\\{\\hat{m}\\}\\) with filter()} and plot it: ## estimate of trend co2.trend &lt;- filter(co2, filter=fltr, method=&quot;convo&quot;, sides=2) ## plot the trend plot.ts(co2.trend, ylab=&quot;Trend&quot;, cex=1) The trend is a more-or-less smoothly increasing function over time, the average slope of which does indeed appear to be increasing over time as well (Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3: Time series of the estimated trend \\(\\{\\hat{m}_t\\}\\) for the atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i. 4.2.2 Estimating seasonal effects Once we have an estimate of the trend for time \\(t\\) (\\(\\hat{m}_t\\)) we can easily obtain an estimate of the seasonal effect at time \\(t\\) (\\(\\hat{s}_t\\)) by subtraction \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.4} \\hat{s}_t = x_t - \\hat{m}_t, \\end{equation}\\] which is really easy to do in R: ## seasonal effect over time co2.1T &lt;- co2 - co2.trend This estimate of the seasonal effect for each time \\(t\\) also contains the random error \\(e_t\\), however, which can be seen by plotting the time series and careful comparison of Equations (4.1) and (4.4). ## plot the monthly seasonal effects plot.ts(co2.1T, ylab=&quot;Seasonal effect&quot;, xlab=&quot;Month&quot;, cex=1) Figure 4.4: Time series of seasonal effects plus random errors for the atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i, measured monthly from March 1958 to present. We can obtain the overall seasonal effect by averaging the estimates of \\(\\{\\hat{s}_t\\}\\) for each month and repeating this sequence over all years. ## length of ts ll &lt;- length(co2.1T) ## frequency (ie, 12) ff &lt;- frequency(co2.1T) ## number of periods (years); %/% is integer division periods &lt;- ll %/% ff ## index of cumulative month index &lt;- seq(1,ll,by=ff) - 1 ## get mean by month mm &lt;- numeric(ff) for(i in 1:ff) { mm[i] &lt;- mean(co2.1T[index+i], na.rm=TRUE) } ## subtract mean to make overall mean=0 mm &lt;- mm - mean(mm) Before we create the entire time series of seasonal effects, let’s plot them for each month to see what is happening within a year: ## plot the monthly seasonal effects plot.ts(mm, ylab=&quot;Seasonal effect&quot;, xlab=&quot;Month&quot;, cex=1) It looks like, on average, that the CO\\(_2\\) concentration is highest in spring (March) and lowest in summer (August) (Figure 4.5). (Aside: Do you know why this is?) Figure 4.5: Estimated monthly seasonal effects for the atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i. Finally, let’s create the entire time series of seasonal effects \\(\\{\\hat{s}_t\\}\\): ## create ts object for season co2.seas &lt;- ts(rep(mm, periods+1)[seq(ll)], start=start(co2.1T), frequency=ff) 4.2.3 Completing the model The last step in completing our full decomposition model is obtaining the random errors \\(\\{\\hat{e}_t\\}\\), which we can get via simple subtraction \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.5} \\hat{e}_t = x_t - \\hat{m}_t - \\hat{s}_t. \\end{equation}\\] Again, this is really easy in R: ## random errors over time co2.err &lt;- co2 - co2.trend - co2.seas Now that we have all 3 of our model components, let’s plot them together with the observed data \\(\\{x_t\\}\\). The results are shown in Figure 4.6. ## plot the obs ts, trend &amp; seasonal effect plot(cbind(co2,co2.trend,co2.seas,co2.err),main=&quot;&quot;,yax.flip=TRUE) Figure 4.6: Time series of the observed atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i (top) along with the estimated trend, seasonal effects, and random errors. 4.2.4 Using decompose() for decomposition Now that we have seen how to estimate and plot the various components of a classical decomposition model in a piecewise manner, let’s see how to do this in one step in R with the function decompose(), which accepts a ts object as input and returns an object of class decomposed.ts. ## decomposition of CO2 data co2.decomp &lt;- decompose(co2) co2.decomp is a list with the following elements, which should be familiar by now: x the observed time series \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) seasonal time series of estimated seasonal component \\(\\{\\hat{s}_t\\}\\) figure mean seasonal effect (length(figure) == frequency(x)) trend time series of estimated trend \\(\\{\\hat{m}_t\\}\\) random time series of random errors \\(\\{\\hat{e}_t\\}\\) type type of error (&quot;additive&quot; or &quot;multiplicative&quot;) We can easily make plots of the output and compare them to those in Figure 4.6: ## plot the obs ts, trend &amp; seasonal effect plot(co2.decomp, yax.flip=TRUE) Figure 4.7: Time series of the observed atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i (top) along with the estimated trend, seasonal effects, and random errors obtained with the function decompose(). The results obtained with decompose() (Figure 4.7) are identical to those we estimated previously. Another nice feature of the decompose() function is that it can be used for decomposition models with multiplicative (i.e., non-additive) errors (e.g., if the original time series had a seasonal amplitude that increased with time). To do, so pass in the argument type=&quot;multiplicative&quot;, which is set to type=&quot;additive&quot; by default. "],
["sec-tslab-differencing-to-remove-a-trend-or-seasonal-effects.html", "4.3 Differencing to remove a trend or seasonal effects", " 4.3 Differencing to remove a trend or seasonal effects An alternative to decomposition for removing trends is differencing. We saw in lecture how the difference operator works and how it can be used to remove linear and nonlinear trends as well as various seasonal features that might be evident in the data. As a reminder, we define the difference operator as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.6} \\nabla x_t = x_t - x_{t-1}, \\end{equation}\\] and, more generally, for order \\(d\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.7} \\nabla^d x_t = (1-\\mathbf{B})^d x_t, \\end{equation}\\] where B is the backshift operator (i.e., \\(\\mathbf{B}^k x_t = x_{t-k}\\) for \\(k \\geq 1\\)). So, for example, a random walk is one of the most simple and widely used time series models, but it is not stationary. We can write a random walk model as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.8} x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t, \\text{ with } w_t \\sim \\text{N}(0,q). \\end{equation}\\] Applying the difference operator to Equation (4.8) will yield a time series of Gaussian white noise errors \\(\\{w_t\\}\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.9} \\begin{aligned} \\nabla (x_t &amp;= x_{t-1} + w_t) \\\\ x_t - x_{t-1} &amp;= x_{t-1} - x_{t-1} + w_t \\\\ x_t - x_{t-1} &amp;= w_t \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] 4.3.1 Using the diff() function In R we can use the diff() function for differencing a time series, which requires 3 arguments: x (the data), lag (the lag at which to difference), and differences (the order of differencing; \\(d\\) in Equation (4.7)). For example, first-differencing a time series will remove a linear trend (i.e., differences=1); twice-differencing will remove a quadratic trend (i.e., differences=2). In addition, first-differencing a time series at a lag equal to the period will remove a seasonal trend (e.g., set lag=12 for monthly data). Let’s use diff() to remove the trend and seasonal signal from the CO\\(_2\\) time series, beginning with the trend. Close inspection of Figure 4.1 would suggest that there is a nonlinear increase in CO\\(_2\\) concentration over time, so we’ll set differences=2): ## twice-difference the CO2 data co2.D2 &lt;- diff(co2, differences=2) ## plot the differenced data plot(co2.D2, ylab=expression(paste(nabla^2,&quot;CO&quot;[2]))) Figure 4.8: Time series of the twice-differenced atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i. We were apparently successful in removing the trend, but the seasonal effect still appears obvious (Figure 4.8). Therefore, let’s go ahead and difference that series at lag-12 because our data were collected monthly. ## difference the differenced CO2 data co2.D2D12 &lt;- diff(co2.D2, lag=12) ## plot the newly differenced data plot(co2.D2D12, ylab=expression(paste(nabla,&quot;(&quot;,nabla^2,&quot;CO&quot;[2],&quot;)&quot;))) Figure 4.9: Time series of the lag-12 difference of the twice-differenced atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i. Now we have a time series that appears to be random errors without any obvious trend or seasonal components (Figure 4.9). "],
["sec-tslab-correlation-within-and-among-time-series.html", "4.4 Correlation within and among time series", " 4.4 Correlation within and among time series The concepts of covariance and correlation are very important in time series analysis. In particular, we can examine the correlation structure of the original data or random errors from a decomposition model to help us identify possible form(s) of (non)stationary model(s) for the stochastic process. 4.4.1 Autocorrelation function (ACF) Autocorrelation is the correlation of a variable with itself at differing time lags. Recall from lecture that we defined the sample autocovariance function (ACVF), \\(c_k\\), for some lag \\(k\\) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.10} c_k = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^{n-k} \\left(x_t-\\bar{x}\\right) \\left(x_{t+k}-\\bar{x}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] Note that the sample autocovariance of \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) at lag 0, \\(c_0\\), equals the sample variance of \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) calculated with a denominator of \\(n\\). The sample autocorrelation function (ACF) is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.11} r_k = \\frac{c_k}{c_0} = \\text{Cor}(x_t,x_{t+k}) \\end{equation}\\] Recall also that an approximate 95% confidence interval on the ACF can be estimated by \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.12} -\\frac{1}{n} \\pm \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of data points used in the calculation of the ACF. It is important to remember two things here. First, although the confidence interval is commonly plotted and interpreted as a horizontal line over all time lags, the interval itself actually grows as the lag increases because the number of data points \\(n\\) used to estimate the correlation decreases by 1 for every integer increase in lag. Second, care must be exercised when interpreting the “significance” of the correlation at various lags because we should expect, a priori, that approximately 1 out of every 20 correlations will be significant based on chance alone. We can use the acf() function in R to compute the sample ACF (note that adding the option type=&quot;covariance&quot; will return the sample auto-covariance (ACVF) instead of the ACF–type ?acf for details). Calling the function by itself will will automatically produce a correlogram (i.e., a plot of the autocorrelation versus time lag). The argument lag.max allows you to set the number of positive and negative lags. Let’s try it for the CO\\(_2\\) data. ## correlogram of the CO2 data acf(co2, lag.max=36) Figure 4.10: Correlogram of the observed atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i obtained with the function acf(). There are 4 things about Figure 4.10 that are noteworthy: the ACF at lag 0, \\(r_0\\), equals 1 by default (i.e., the correlation of a time series with itself)–it’s plotted as a reference point; the \\(x\\)-axis has decimal values for lags, which is caused by R using the year index as the lag rather than the month; the horizontal blue lines are the approximate 95% CI’s; and there is very high autocorrelation even out to lags of 36 months. As an alternative to the default plots for acf objects, let’s define a new plot function for acf objects with some better features: ## better ACF plot plot.acf &lt;- function(ACFobj) { rr &lt;- ACFobj$acf[-1] kk &lt;- length(rr) nn &lt;- ACFobj$n.used plot(seq(kk),rr,type=&quot;h&quot;,lwd=2,yaxs=&quot;i&quot;,xaxs=&quot;i&quot;, ylim=c(floor(min(rr)),1),xlim=c(0,kk+1), xlab=&quot;Lag&quot;,ylab=&quot;Correlation&quot;,las=1) abline(h=-1/nn+c(-2,2)/sqrt(nn),lty=&quot;dashed&quot;,col=&quot;blue&quot;) abline(h=0) } Now we can assign the result of acf() to a variable and then use the information contained therein to plot the correlogram with our new plot function. ## acf of the CO2 data co2.acf &lt;- acf(co2, lag.max=36) ## correlogram of the CO2 data plot.acf(co2.acf) Figure 4.11: Correlogram of the observed atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i obtained with the function plot.acf(). Notice that all of the relevant information is still there (Figure 4.11), but now \\(r_0=1\\) is not plotted at lag-0 and the lags on the \\(x\\)-axis are displayed correctly as integers. Before we move on to the PACF, let’s look at the ACF for some deterministic time series, which will help you identify interesting properties (e.g., trends, seasonal effects) in a stochastic time series, and account for them in time series models–an important topic in this course. First, let’s look at a straight line. ## length of ts nn &lt;- 100 ## create straight line tt &lt;- seq(nn) ## set up plot area par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## plot line plot.ts(tt, ylab=expression(italic(x[t]))) ## get ACF line.acf &lt;- acf(tt, plot=FALSE) ## plot ACF plot.acf(line.acf) Figure 4.12: Time series plot of a straight line (left) and the correlogram of its ACF (right). The correlogram for a straight line is itself a linearly decreasing function over time (Figure 4.12). Now let’s examine the ACF for a sine wave and see what sort of pattern arises. ## create sine wave tt &lt;- sin(2*pi*seq(nn)/12) ## set up plot area par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## plot line plot.ts(tt, ylab=expression(italic(x[t]))) ## get ACF sine.acf &lt;- acf(tt, plot=FALSE) ## plot ACF plot.acf(sine.acf) Figure 4.13: Time series plot of a discrete sine wave (left) and the correlogram of its ACF (right). Perhaps not surprisingly, the correlogram for a sine wave is itself a sine wave whose amplitude decreases linearly over time (Figure 4.13). Now let’s examine the ACF for a sine wave with a linear downward trend and see what sort of patterns arise. ## create sine wave with trend tt &lt;- sin(2*pi*seq(nn)/12) - seq(nn)/50 ## set up plot area par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## plot line plot.ts(tt, ylab=expression(italic(x[t]))) ## get ACF sili.acf &lt;- acf(tt, plot=FALSE) ## plot ACF plot.acf(sili.acf) Figure 4.14: Time series plot of a discrete sine wave (left) and the correlogram of its ACF (right). The correlogram for a sine wave with a trend is itself a nonsymmetrical sine wave whose amplitude and center decrease over time (Figure 4.14). As we have seen, the ACF is a powerful tool in time series analysis for identifying important features in the data. As we will see later, the ACF is also an important diagnostic tool for helping to select the proper order of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) in ARMA(\\(p\\),\\(q\\)) models. 4.4.2 Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) measures the linear correlation of a series \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) and a lagged version of itself \\(\\{x_{t+k}\\}\\) with the linear dependence of \\(\\{x_{t-1},x_{t-2},\\dots,x_{t-(k-1)}\\}\\) removed. Recall from lecture that we define the PACF as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.13} f_k = \\begin{cases} \\text{Cor}(x_1,x_0)=r_1 &amp; \\text{if } k = 1;\\\\ \\text{Cor}(x_k-x_k^{k-1},x_0-x_0^{k-1}) &amp; \\text{if } k \\geq 2; \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] with It’s easy to compute the PACF for a variable in R using the pacf() function, which will automatically plot a correlogram when called by itself (similar to acf()). Let’s look at the PACF for the CO\\(_2\\) data. ## PACF of the CO2 data pacf(co2, lag.max=36) The default plot for PACF is a bit better than for ACF, but here is another plotting function that might be useful. ## better PACF plot plot.pacf &lt;- function(PACFobj) { rr &lt;- PACFobj$acf kk &lt;- length(rr) nn &lt;- PACFobj$n.used plot(seq(kk),rr,type=&quot;h&quot;,lwd=2,yaxs=&quot;i&quot;,xaxs=&quot;i&quot;, ylim=c(floor(min(rr)),1),xlim=c(0,kk+1), xlab=&quot;Lag&quot;,ylab=&quot;PACF&quot;,las=1) abline(h=-1/nn+c(-2,2)/sqrt(nn),lty=&quot;dashed&quot;,col=&quot;blue&quot;) abline(h=0) } Figure 4.15: Correlogram of the PACF for the observed atmospheric CO\\(_2\\) concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai’i obtained with the function pacf(). Notice in Figure 4.15 that the partial autocorrelation at lag-1 is very high (it equals the ACF at lag-1), but the other values at lags &gt; 1 are relatively small, unlike what we saw for the ACF. We will discuss this in more detail later on in this lab. Notice also that the PACF plot again has real-valued indices for the time lag, but it does not include any value for lag-0 because it is impossible to remove any intermediate autocorrelation between \\(t\\) and \\(t-k\\) when \\(k=0\\), and therefore the PACF does not exist at lag-0. If you would like, you can use the plot.acf() function we defined above to plot the PACF estimates because acf() and pacf() produce identical list structures (results not shown here). ## PACF of the CO2 data co2.pacf &lt;- pacf(co2) ## correlogram of the CO2 data plot.acf(co2.pacf) As with the ACF, we will see later on how the PACF can also be used to help identify the appropriate order of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) in ARMA(\\(p\\),\\(q\\)) models. 4.4.3 Cross-correlation function (CCF) Often we are interested in looking for relationships between 2 different time series. There are many ways to do this, but a simple method is via examination of their cross-covariance and cross-correlation. We begin by defining the sample cross-covariance function (CCVF) in a manner similar to the ACVF, in that \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.14} g_k^{xy} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{t=1}^{n-k} \\left(y_t-\\bar{y}\\right) \\left(x_{t+k}-\\bar{x}\\right), \\end{equation}\\] but now we are estimating the correlation between a variable \\(y\\) and a different time-shifted variable \\(x_{t+k}\\). The sample cross-correlation function (CCF) is then defined analogously to the ACF, such that \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.15} r_k^{xy} = \\frac{g_k^{xy}}{\\sqrt{\\text{SD}_x\\text{SD}_y}}; \\end{equation}\\] SD\\(_x\\) and SD\\(_y\\) are the sample standard deviations of \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) and \\(\\{y_t\\}\\), respectively. It is important to re-iterate here that \\(r_k^{xy} \\neq r_{-k}^{xy}\\), but \\(r_k^{xy} = r_{-k}^{yx}\\). Therefore, it is very important to pay particular attention to which variable you call \\(y\\) (i.e., the “response”) and which you call \\(x\\) (i.e., the “predictor”). As with the ACF, an approximate 95% confidence interval on the CCF can be estimated by \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.16} -\\frac{1}{n} \\pm \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{n}} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of data points used in the calculation of the CCF, and the same assumptions apply to its interpretation. Computing the CCF in R is easy with the function ccf() and it works just like acf(). In fact, ccf() is just a “wrapper” function that calls acf(). As an example, let’s examine the CCF between sunspot activity and number of lynx trapped in Canada as in the classic paper by Moran. To begin, let’s get the data, which are conveniently included in the datasets package included as part of the base installation of R. Before calculating the CCF, however, we need to find the matching years of data. Again, we’ll use the ts.intersect() function. ## get the matching years of sunspot data suns &lt;- ts.intersect(lynx,sunspot.year)[,&quot;sunspot.year&quot;] ## get the matching lynx data lynx &lt;- ts.intersect(lynx,sunspot.year)[,&quot;lynx&quot;] Here are plots of the time series. ## plot time series plot(cbind(suns,lynx), yax.flip=TRUE) Figure 4.16: Time series of sunspot activity (top) and lynx trappings in Canada (bottom) from 1821-1934. It is important to remember which of the 2 variables you call \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) when calling ccf(x, y, ...). In this case, it seems most relevant to treat lynx as the \\(y\\) and sunspots as the \\(x\\), in which case we are mostly interested in the CCF at negative lags (i.e., when sunspot activity predates inferred lynx abundance). Furthermore, we’ll use log-transformed lynx trappings. ## CCF of sunspots and lynx ccf(suns, log(lynx), ylab=&quot;Cross-correlation&quot;) Figure 4.17: CCF for annual sunspot activity and the log of the number of lynx trappings in Canada from 1821-1934. From Figures 4.16 and 4.17 it looks like lynx numbers are relatively low 3-5 years after high sunspot activity (i.e., significant correlation at lags of -3 to -5). "],

If our time series model has done an adequate job of removing all of the serial autocorrelation in the time series with trends, seasonal effects, etc., then the model residuals (\\(e_t = y_t - \\hat{y}_t\\)) will be a WN sequence with the following properties for its mean (\\(\\bar{e}\\)), covariance (\\(c_k\\)), and autocorrelation (\\(r_k\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.17} \\begin{aligned} \\bar{x} &amp;= 0 \\\\ c_k &amp;= \\text{Cov}(e_t,e_{t+k}) = \\begin{cases} q &amp; \\text{if } k = 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } k \\neq 1 \\end{cases} \\\\ r_k &amp;= \\text{Cor}(e_t,e_{t+k}) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{if } k = 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } k \\neq 1. \\end{cases} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] 4.5.1 Simulating white noise Simulating WN in R is straightforward with a variety of built-in random number generators for continuous and discrete distributions. Once you know R’s abbreviation for the distribution of interest, you add an \\(\\texttt{r}\\) to the beginning to get the function’s name. For example, a Gaussian (or normal) distribution is abbreviated \\(\\texttt{norm}\\) and so the function is rnorm(). All of the random number functions require two things: the number of samples from the distribution and the parameters for the distribution itself (e.g., mean &amp; SD of a normal). Check the help file for the distribution of interest to find out what parameters you must specify (e.g., type ?rnorm to see the help for a normal distribution). Here’s how to generate 100 samples from a normal distribution with mean of 5 and standard deviation of 0.2, and 50 samples from a Poisson distribution with a rate (\\(\\lambda\\)) of 20. set.seed(123) ## random normal variates GWN &lt;- rnorm(n=100, mean=5, sd=0.2) ## random Poisson variates PWN &lt;- rpois(n=50, lambda=20) Here are plots of the time series. Notice that on one occasion the same number was drawn twice in a row from the Poisson distribution, which is discrete. That is virtually guaranteed to never happen with a continuous distribution. ## set up plot region par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## plot normal variates with mean plot.ts(GWN) abline(h=5, col=&quot;blue&quot;, lty=&quot;dashed&quot;) ## plot Poisson variates with mean plot.ts(PWN) abline(h=20, col=&quot;blue&quot;, lty=&quot;dashed&quot;) Figure 4.18: Time series plots of simulated Gaussian (left) and Poisson (right) white noise. Now let’s examine the ACF for the 2 white noise series and see if there is, in fact, zero autocorrelation for lags \\(\\geq\\) 1. ## set up plot region par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## plot normal variates with mean acf(GWN, main=&quot;&quot;, lag.max=20) ## plot Poisson variates with mean acf(PWN, main=&quot;&quot;, lag.max=20) Figure 4.19: ACF’s for the simulated Gaussian (left) and Poisson (right) white noise shown in Figure 4.18. Interestingly, the \\(r_k\\) are all greater than zero in absolute value although they are not statistically different from zero for lags 1-20. This is because we are dealing with a sample of the distributions rather than the entire population of all random variates. As an exercise, try setting n=1e6 instead of n=100 or n=50 in the calls calls above to generate the WN sequences and see what effect it has on the estimation of \\(r_k\\). It is also important to remember, as we discussed earlier, that we should expect that approximately 1 in 20 of the \\(r_k\\) will be statistically greater than zero based on chance alone, especially for relatively small sample sizes, so don’t get too excited if you ever come across a case like then when inspecting model residuals.

["sec-tslab-random-walks-rw.html", "4.6 Random walks (RW)", " 4.6 Random walks (RW) Random walks receive considerable attention in time series analyses because of their ability to fit a wide range of data despite their surprising simplicity. In fact, random walks are the most simple non-stationary time series model. A random walk is a time series \\(\\{x_t\\}\\) where \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.18} x_t = x_{t-1} + w_t, \\end{equation}\\] and \\(w_t\\) is a discrete white noise series where all values are independent and identically distributed (IID) with a mean of zero. In practice, we will almost always assume that the \\(w_t\\) are Gaussian white noise, such that \\(w_t \\sim \\text{N}(0,q)\\). We will see later that a random walk is a special case of an autoregressive model. 4.6.1 Simulating a random walk Simulating a RW model in R is straightforward with a for loop and the use of rnorm() to generate Gaussian errors (type ?rnorm to see details on the function and its useful relatives dnorm() and pnorm()). Let’s create 100 obs (we’ll also set the random number seed so everyone gets the same results). ## set random number seed set.seed(123) ## length of time series TT &lt;- 100 ## initialize {x_t} and {w_t} xx &lt;- ww &lt;- rnorm(n=TT, mean=0, sd=1) ## compute values 2 thru TT for(t in 2:TT) { xx[t] &lt;- xx[t-1] + ww[t] } Now let’s plot the simulated time series and its ACF. ## setup plot area par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## plot line plot.ts(xx, ylab=expression(italic(x[t]))) ## plot ACF plot.acf(acf(xx, plot=FALSE)) Figure 4.20: Simulated time series of a random walk model (left) and its associated ACF (right). Perhaps not surprisingly based on their names, autoregressive models such as RW’s have a high degree of autocorrelation out to long lags (Figure 4.20). 4.6.2 Alternative formulation of a random walk As an aside, let’s use an alternative formulation of a random walk model to see an even shorter way to simulate an RW in R. Based on our definition of a random walk in Equation (4.18), it is easy to see that \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.19} \\begin{aligned} x_t &amp;= x_{t-1} + w_t \\\\ x_{t-1} &amp;= x_{t-2} + w_{t-1} \\\\ x_{t-2} &amp;= x_{t-3} + w_{t-2} \\\\ &amp;\\; \\; \\vdots \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] Therefore, if we substitute \\(x_{t-2} + w_{t-1}\\) for \\(x_{t-1}\\) in the first equation, and then \\(x_{t-3} + w_{t-2}\\) for \\(x_{t-2}\\), and so on in a recursive manner, we get \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.20} x_t = w_t + w_{t-1} + w_{t-2} + \\dots + w_{t-\\infty} + x_{t-\\infty}. \\end{equation}\\] In practice, however, the time series will not start an infinite time ago, but rather at some \\(t=1\\), in which case we can write \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.21} \\begin{aligned} x_t &amp;= w_1 + w_2 + \\dots + w_t \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{t=1}^{T} w_t. \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] From Equation (4.21) it is easy to see that the value of an RW process at time step \\(t\\) is the sum of all the random errors up through time \\(t\\). Therefore, in R we can easily simulate a realization from an RW process using the cumsum(x) function, which does cumulative summation of the vector x over its entire length. If we use the same errors as before, we should get the same results. ## simulate RW x2 &lt;- cumsum(ww) Let’s plot both time series to see if it worked. ## setup plot area par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## plot 1st RW plot.ts(xx, ylab=expression(italic(x[t]))) ## plot 2nd RW plot.ts(x2, ylab=expression(italic(x[t]))) Figure 4.21: Time series of the same random walk model formulated as Equation (4.18) and simulated via a for loop (left), and as Equation (4.21) and simulated via cumsum() (right). Indeed, both methods of generating a RW time series appear to be equivalent. "],
["sec-tslab-autoregressive-ar-models.html", "4.7 Autoregressive (AR) models", " 4.7 Autoregressive (AR) models Autoregressive models of order \\(p\\), abbreviated AR(\\(p\\)), are commonly used in time series analyses. In particular, AR(1) models (and their multivariate extensions) see considerable use in ecology as we will see later in the course. Recall from lecture that an AR(\\(p\\)) model is written as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.22} x_t = \\phi_1 x_{t-1} + \\phi_2 x_{t-2} + \\dots + \\phi_p x_{t-p} + w_t, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\{w_t\\}\\) is a white noise sequence with zero mean and some variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). For our purposes we usually assume that \\(w_t \\sim \\text{N}(0,q)\\). Note that the random walk in Equation (4.18) is a special case of an AR(1) model where \\(\\phi_1=1\\) and \\(\\phi_k=0\\) for \\(k \\geq 2\\). 4.7.1 Simulating an AR(\\(p\\)) process Although we could simulate an AR(\\(p\\)) process in R using a for loop just as we did for a random walk, it’s much easier with the function arima.sim(), which works for all forms and subsets of ARIMA models. To do so, remember that the AR in ARIMA stands for “autoregressive”, the I for “integrated”, and the MA for “moving-average”; we specify the order of ARIMA models as \\(p,d,q\\). So, for example, we would specify an AR(2) model as ARIMA(2,0,0), or an MA(1) model as ARIMA(0,0,1). If we had an ARMA(3,1) model that we applied to data that had been twice-differenced, then we would have an ARIMA(3,2,1) model. arima.sim() will accept many arguments, but we are interested primarily in two of them: n and model (type ?arima.sim to learn more). The former simply indicates the length of desired time series, but the latter is more complex. Specifically, model is a list with the following elements: order a vector of length 3 containing the ARIMA(\\(p,d,q\\)) order ar a vector of length \\(p\\) containing the AR(\\(p\\)) coefficients ma a vector of length \\(q\\) containing the MA(\\(q\\)) coefficients sd a scalar indicating the std dev of the Gaussian errors Note that you can omit the ma element entirely if you have an AR(\\(p\\)) model, or omit the ar element if you have an MA(\\(q\\)) model. If you omit the sd element, arima.sim() will assume you want normally distributed errors with SD = 1. Also note that you can pass arima.sim() your own time series of random errors or the name of a function that will generate the errors (e.g., you could use rpois() if you wanted a model with Poisson errors). Type ?arima.sim for more details. Let’s begin by simulating some AR(1) models and comparing their behavior. First, let’s choose models with contrasting AR coefficients. Recall that in order for an AR(1) model to be stationary, \\(\\phi &lt; \\lvert 1 \\rvert\\), so we’ll try 0.1 and 0.9. We’ll again set the random number seed so we will get the same answers. set.seed(456) ## list description for AR(1) model with small coef AR.sm &lt;- list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=0.1, sd=0.1) ## list description for AR(1) model with large coef AR.lg &lt;- list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=0.9, sd=0.1) ## simulate AR(1) AR1.sm &lt;- arima.sim(n=50, model=AR.sm) AR1.lg &lt;- arima.sim(n=50, model=AR.lg) Now let’s plot the 2 simulated series. ## setup plot region par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## get y-limits for common plots ylm &lt;- c(min(AR1.sm,AR1.lg), max(AR1.sm,AR1.lg)) ## plot the ts plot.ts(AR1.sm, ylim=ylm, ylab=expression(italic(x)[italic(t)]), main=expression(paste(phi,&quot; = 0.1&quot;))) plot.ts(AR1.lg, ylim=ylm, ylab=expression(italic(x)[italic(t)]), main=expression(paste(phi,&quot; = 0.9&quot;))) Figure 4.22: Time series of simulated AR(1) processes with \\(\\phi=0.1\\) (left) and \\(\\phi=0.9\\) (right). What do you notice about the two plots in Figure 4.22? It looks like the time series with the smaller AR coefficient is more “choppy” and seems to stay closer to 0 whereas the time series with the larger AR coefficient appears to wander around more. Remember that as the coefficient in an AR(1) model goes to 0, the model approaches a WN sequence, which is stationary in both the mean and variance. As the coefficient goes to 1, however, the model approaches a random walk, which is not stationary in either the mean or variance. Next, let’s generate two AR(1) models that have the same magnitude coeficient, but opposite signs, and compare their behavior. set.seed(123) ## list description for AR(1) model with small coef AR.pos &lt;- list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=0.5, sd=0.1) ## list description for AR(1) model with large coef AR.neg &lt;- list(order=c(1,0,0), ar=-0.5, sd=0.1) ## simulate AR(1) AR1.pos &lt;- arima.sim(n=50, model=AR.pos) AR1.neg &lt;- arima.sim(n=50, model=AR.neg) OK, let’s plot the 2 simulated series. ## setup plot region par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ## get y-limits for common plots ylm &lt;- c(min(AR1.pos,AR1.neg), max(AR1.pos,AR1.neg)) ## plot the ts plot.ts(AR1.pos, ylim=ylm, ylab=expression(italic(x)[italic(t)]), main=expression(paste(phi[1],&quot; = 0.5&quot;))) plot.ts(AR1.neg, ylab=expression(italic(x)[italic(t)]), main=expression(paste(phi[1],&quot; = -0.5&quot;))) Figure 4.23: Time series of simulated AR(1) processes with \\(\\phi_1=0.5\\) (left) and \\(\\phi_1=-0.5\\) (right). Now it appears like both time series vary around the mean by about the same amount, but the model with the negative coefficient produces a much more “sawtooth” time series. It turns out that any AR(1) model with \\(-1&lt;\\phi&lt;0\\) will exhibit the 2-point oscillation you see here. We can simulate higher order AR(\\(p\\)) models in the same manner, but care must be exercised when choosing a set of coefficients that result in a stationary model or else arima.sim() will fail and report an error. For example, an AR(2) model with both coefficients equal to 0.5 is not stationary, and therefore this function call will not work: arima.sim(n=100, model=list(order(2,0,0), ar=c(0.5,0.5))) If you try, R will respond that the “'ar' part of model is not stationary”. 4.7.2 Correlation structure of AR(\\(p\\)) processes Let’s review what we learned in lecture about the general behavior of the ACF and PACF for AR(\\(p\\)) models. To do so, we’ll simulate four stationary AR(\\(p\\)) models of increasing order \\(p\\) and then examine their ACF’s and PACF’s. Let’s use a really big \\(n\\) so as to make them “pure”, which will provide a much better estimate of the correlation structure. set.seed(123) ## the 4 AR coefficients ARp &lt;- c(0.7, 0.2, -0.1, -0.3) ## empty list for storing models AR.mods &lt;- list() ## loop over orders of p for(p in 1:4) { ## assume SD=1, so not specified AR.mods[[p]] &lt;- arima.sim(n=10000, list(ar=ARp[1:p])) } Now that we have our four AR(\\(p\\)) models, lets look at plots of the time series, ACF’s, and PACF’s. ## set up plot region par(mfrow=c(4,3)) ## loop over orders of p for(p in 1:4) { plot.ts(AR.mods[[p]][1:50], ylab=paste(&quot;AR(&quot;,p,&quot;)&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;)) acf(AR.mods[[p]], lag.max=12) pacf(AR.mods[[p]], lag.max=12, ylab=&quot;PACF&quot;) } Figure 4.24: Time series of simulated AR(\\(p\\)) processes (left column) of increasing orders from 1-4 (rows) with their associated ACF’s (center column) and PACF’s (right column). Note that only the first 50 values of \\(x_t\\) are plotted. As we saw in lecture and is evident from our examples shown in Figure 4.24, the ACF for an AR(\\(p\\)) process tails off toward zero very slowly, but the PACF goes to zero for lags &gt; \\(p\\). This is an important diagnostic tool when trying to identify the order of \\(p\\) in ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) models. "],
["sec-tslab-moving-average-ma-models.html", "4.8 Moving-average (MA) models", " 4.8 Moving-average (MA) models A moving-averge process of order \\(q\\), or MA(\\(q\\)), is a weighted sum of the current random error plus the \\(q\\) most recent errors, and can be written as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.23} x_t = w_t + \\theta_1 w_{t-1} + \\theta_2 w_{t-2} + \\dots + \\theta_q w_{t-q}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\{w_t\\}\\) is a white noise sequence with zero mean and some variance \\(\\sigma^2\\); for our purposes we usually assume that \\(w_t \\sim \\text{N}(0,q)\\). Of particular note is that because MA processes are finite sums of stationary errors, they themselves are stationary. Of interest to us are so-called “invertible” MA processes that can be expressed as an infinite AR process with no error term. The term invertible comes from the inversion of the backshift operator (B) that we discussed in class (i.e., \\(\\mathbf{B} x_t= x_{t-1}\\)). So, for example, an MA(1) process with \\(\\theta &lt; \\lvert 1 \\rvert\\) is invertible because it can be written using the backshift operator as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.24} \\begin{aligned} x_t &amp;= w_t - \\theta w_{t-1} \\\\ x_t &amp;= w_t - \\theta \\mathbf{B} w_t \\\\ x_t &amp;= (1 - \\theta \\mathbf{B}) w_t, \\\\ &amp;\\Downarrow \\\\ w_t &amp;= \\frac{1}{(1 - \\theta \\mathbf{B})} x_t \\\\ w_t &amp;= (1 + \\theta \\mathbf{B} + \\theta^2 \\mathbf{B}^2 + \\theta^3 \\mathbf{B}^3 + \\dots) x_t \\\\ w_t &amp;= x_t + \\theta x_{t-1} + \\theta^2 x_{t-2} + \\theta^3 x_{t-3} + \\dots \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] 4.8.1 Simulating an MA(\\(q\\)) process We can simulate MA(\\(q\\)) processes just as we did for AR(\\(p\\)) processes using arima.sim().

This should not be too surprising given that they are simply linear combinations of white noise. 4.8.2 Correlation structure of MA(\\(q\\)) processes We saw in lecture and above how the ACF and PACF have distinctive features for AR(\\(p\\)) models, and they do for MA(\\(q\\)) models as well. Here are examples of four MA(\\(q\\)) processes. As before, we’ll use a really big \\(n\\) so as to make them “pure”, which will provide a much better estimate of the correlation structure. set.seed(123) ## the 4 MA coefficients MAq &lt;- c(0.7, 0.2, -0.1, -0.3) ## empty list for storing models MA.mods &lt;- list() ## loop over orders of q for(q in 1:4) { ## assume SD=1, so not specified MA.mods[[q]] &lt;- arima.sim(n=1000, list(ma=MAq[1:q])) } Now that we have our four MA(\\(q\\)) models, lets look at plots of the time series, ACF’s, and PACF’s. ## set up plot region par(mfrow=c(4,3)) ## loop over orders of q for(q in 1:4) { plot.ts(MA.mods[[q]][1:50], ylab=paste(&quot;MA(&quot;,q,&quot;)&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;)) acf(MA.mods[[q]], lag.max=12) pacf(MA.mods[[q]], lag.max=12, ylab=&quot;PACF&quot;) } Figure 4.26: Time series of simulated MA(\\(q\\)) processes (left column) of increasing orders from 1-4 (rows) with their associated ACF’s (center column) and PACF’s (right column).

["sec-tslab-autoregressive-moving-average-arma-models.html", "4.9 Autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models", " 4.9 Autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) models have a rich history in the time series literature, but they are not nearly as common in ecology as plain AR(\\(p\\)) models. As we discussed in lecture, both the ACF and PACF are important tools when trying to identify the appropriate order of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Here we will see how to simulate time series from AR(\\(p\\)), MA(\\(q\\)), and ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) processes, as well as fit time series models to data based on insights gathered from the ACF and PACF. We can write an ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) as a mixture of AR(\\(p\\)) and MA(\\(q\\)) models, such that \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.25} x_t = \\phi_1x_{t-1} + \\phi_2x_{t-2} + \\dots + \\phi_p x_{t-p} + w_t + \\theta w_{t-1} + \\theta_2 w_{t-2} + \\dots + \\theta_q x_{t-q}, \\end{equation}\\] and the \\(w_t\\) are white noise. 4.9.1 Fitting ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) models with arima() We have already seen how to simulate AR(\\(p\\)) and MA(\\(q\\)) models with arima.sim(); the same concepts apply to ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) models and therefore we will not do that here. Instead, we will move on to fitting ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) models when we only have a realization of the process (i.e., data) and do not know the underlying parameters that generated it. The function arima() accepts a number of arguments, but two of them are most important: x a univariate time series order a vector of length 3 specifying the order of ARIMA(p,d,q) model In addition, note that by default arima() will estimate an underlying mean of the time series unless \\(d&gt;0\\). For example, an AR(1) process with mean \\(\\mu\\) would be written \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.26} x_t = \\mu + \\phi (x_{t-1} - \\mu) + w_t. \\end{equation}\\] If you know for a fact that the time series data have a mean of zero (e.g., you already subtracted the mean from them), you should include the argument include.mean=FALSE, which is set to TRUE by default. Note that ignoring and not estimating a mean in ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) models when one exists will bias the estimates of all other parameters. Let’s see an example of how arima() works. First we’ll simulate an ARMA(2,2) model and then estimate the parameters to see how well we can recover them. In addition, we’ll add in a constant to create a non-zero mean, which arima() reports as intercept in its output. set.seed(123) ## ARMA(2,2) description for arim.sim() ARMA22 &lt;- list(order=c(2,0,2), ar=c(-0.7,0.2), ma=c(0.7,0.2)) ## mean of process mu &lt;- 5 ## simulated process (+ mean) ARMA.sim &lt;- arima.sim(n=10000, model=ARMA22) + mu ## estimate parameters arima(x=ARMA.sim, order=c(2,0,2)) Call: arima(x = ARMA.sim, order = c(2, 0, 2)) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 intercept -0.7079 0.1924 0.6912 0.2001 4.9975 s.e. 0.0291 0.0284 0.0289 0.0236 0.0125 sigma^2 estimated as 0.9972: log likelihood = -14175.92, aic = 28363.84 It looks like we were pretty good at estimating the true parameters, but our sample size was admittedly quite large; the estimate of the variance of the process errors is reported as sigma^2 below the other coefficients. As an exercise, try decreasing the length of time series in the arima.sim() call above from 10,000 to something like 100 and see what effect it has on the parameter estimates. 4.9.2 Searching over model orders In an ideal situation, you could examine the ACF and PACF of the time series of interest and immediately decipher what orders of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) must have generated the data, but that doesn’t always work in practice. Instead, we are often left with the task of searching over several possible model forms and seeing which of them provides the most parsimonious fit to the data. There are two easy ways to do this for ARIMA models in R. The first is to write a little script that loops ove the possible dimensions of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Let’s try that for the process we simulated above and search over orders of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) from 0-3 (it will take a few moments to run and will likely report an error about a “possible convergence problem”, which you can ignore). ## empty list to store model fits ARMA.res &lt;- list() ## set counter cc &lt;- 1 ## loop over AR for(p in 0:3) { ## loop over MA for(q in 0:3) { ARMA.res[[cc]] &lt;- arima(x=ARMA.sim,order=c(p,0,q)) cc &lt;- cc + 1 } } Warning in arima(x = ARMA.sim, order = c(p, 0, q)): possible convergence problem: optim gave code = 1 ## get AIC values for model evaluation ARMA.AIC &lt;- sapply(ARMA.res,function(x) x$aic) ## model with lowest AIC is the best ARMA.res[[which(ARMA.AIC==min(ARMA.AIC))]] Call: arima(x = ARMA.sim, order = c(p, 0, q)) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 intercept -0.7079 0.1924 0.6912 0.2001 4.9975 s.e. 0.0291 0.0284 0.0289 0.0236 0.0125 sigma^2 estimated as 0.9972: log likelihood = -14175.92, aic = 28363.84 It looks like our search worked, so let’s look at the other method for fitting ARIMA models. The auto.arima() function in the forecast package will conduct an automatic search over all possible orders of ARIMA models that you specify. For details, type ?auto.arima after loading the package. Let’s repeat our search using the same criteria. ## find best ARMA(p,q) model auto.arima(ARMA.sim, start.p=0, max.p=3, start.q=0, max.q=3) Series: ARMA.sim ARIMA(2,0,2) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 mean -0.7079 0.1924 0.6912 0.2001 4.9975 s.e. 0.0291 0.0284 0.0289 0.0236 0.0125 sigma^2 estimated as 0.9977: log likelihood=-14175.92 AIC=28363.84 AICc=28363.84 BIC=28407.1 We get the same results with an increase in speed and less coding, which is nice. If you want to see the form for each of the models checked by auto.arima() and their associated AIC values, include the argument trace=1. "],
["sec-tslab-problems.html", "4.10 Problems", " 4.10 Problems We have seen how to do a variety of introductory time series analyses with R. Now it is your turn to apply the information you learned here and in lecture to complete some analyses. You have been asked by a colleague to help analyze some time series data she collected as part of an experiment on the effects of light and nutrients on the population dynamics of phytoplankton. Specifically, after controlling for differences in light and temperature, she wants to know if the natural log of population density can be modeled with some form of ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) model. The data are expressed as the number of cells per milliliter recorded every hour for one week beginning at 8:00 AM on December 1, 2014. You can load the data using data(hourlyphyto, package = &quot;atsalibrary&quot;) pDat &lt;- hourlyphyto Use the information above to do the following: Convert pDat, which is a data.frame object, into a ts object. This bit of code might be useful to get you started: ## what day of 2014 is Dec 1st? dBegin &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2014-12-01&quot;) dayOfYear &lt;- (dBegin - as.Date(&quot;2014-01-01&quot;) + 1) Plot the time series of phytoplankton density and provide a brief description of any notable features. Although you do not have the actual measurements for the specific temperature and light regimes used in the experiment, you have been informed that they follow a regular light/dark period with accompanying warm/cool temperatures. Thus, estimating a fixed seasonal effect is justifiable. Also, the instrumentation is precise enough to preclude any systematic change in measurements over time (i.e., you can assume \\(m_t = 0\\) for all \\(t\\)). Obtain the time series of the estimated log-density of phytoplankton absent any hourly effects caused by variation in temperature or light. (Hint: You will need to do some decomposition.) Use diagnostic tools to identify the possible order(s) of ARMA model(s) that most likely describes the log of population density for this particular experiment. Note that at this point you should be focusing your analysis on the results obtained in Question 3. Use some form of search to identify what form of ARMA(\\(p,q\\)) model best describes the log of population density for this particular experiment. Use what you learned in Question 4 to inform possible orders of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). (Hint: if you use auto.arima(), include the additional argument seasonal=FALSE) Write out the best model in the form of Equation (4.25) using the underscore notation to refer to subscripts (e.g., write x_t for \\(x_t\\)). You can round any parameters/coefficients to the nearest hundreth. (\\(Hint\\): if the mean of the time series is not zero, refer to Eqn 1.27 in the lab handout). "],

["sec-boxjenkins-stationarity.html", "5.2 Stationarity", " 5.2 Stationarity It is important to test and transform (via differencing) your data to ensure stationarity when fitting an ARMA model using standard algorithms. The standard algorithms for ARIMA models assume stationarity and we will be using those algorithms. It possible to fit ARMA models without transforming the data. We will cover that in later chapters. However, that is not commonly done in the literature on forecasting with ARMA models, certainly not in the literature on catch forecasting. Keep in mind also that many ARMA models are stationary and you do not want to get in the situation of trying to fit an incompatible process model to your data. We will see examples of this when we start fitting models to non-stationary data and random walks. 5.2.1 Look at stationarity in simulated data We will start by looking at white noise and a stationary AR(1) process from simulated data.

["sec-boxjenkins-aug-dickey-fuller.html", "5.3 Dickey-Fuller and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests", " 5.3 Dickey-Fuller and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests 5.3.1 Dickey-Fuller test The Dickey-Fuller test is testing if \\(\\phi=0\\) in this model of the data: \\[y_t = \\alpha + \\beta t + \\phi y_{t-1} + e_t\\] which is written as \\[\\Delta y_t = y_t-y_{t-1}= \\alpha + \\beta t + \\gamma y_{t-1} + e_t\\] where \\(y_t\\) is your data. It is written this way so we can do a linear regression of \\(\\Delta y_t\\) against \\(t\\) and \\(y_{t-1}\\) and test if \\(\\gamma\\) is different from 0. If \\(\\gamma=0\\), then we have a random walk process. If not and \\(-1&lt;1+\\gamma&lt;1\\), then we have a stationary process. 5.3.2 Augmented Dickey-Fuller test The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test allows for higher-order autoregressive processes by including \\(\\Delta y_{t-p}\\) in the model. But our test is still if \\(\\gamma = 0\\). \\[\\Delta y_t = \\alpha + \\beta t + \\gamma y_{t-1} + \\delta_1 \\Delta y_{t-1} + \\delta_2 \\Delta y_{t-2} + \\dots\\] The null hypothesis for both tests is that the data are non-stationary. We want to REJECT the null hypothesis for this test, so we want a p-value of less that 0.05 (or smaller). 5.3.3 ADF test using adf.test() The adf.test() from the tseries package will do a Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (Dickey-Fuller if we set lags equal to 0) with a trend and an intercept. Use ?adf.test to read about this function. The function is adf.test(x, alternative = c(&quot;stationary&quot;, &quot;explosive&quot;), k = trunc((length(x)-1)^(1/3))) x are your data. alternative=&quot;stationary&quot; means that \\(-2&lt;\\gamma&lt;0\\) (\\(-1&lt;\\phi&lt;1\\)) and alternative=&quot;explosive&quot; means that is outside these bounds. k is the number of \\(\\delta\\) lags. For a Dickey-Fuller test, so only up to AR(1) time dependency in our stationary process, we set k=0 so we have no \\(\\delta\\)’s in our test. Being able to control the lags in our test, allows us to avoid a stationarity test that is too complex to be supported by our data. 5.3.3.1 Test on white noise Let’s start by doing the test on data that we know are stationary, white noise. We will use an Augmented Dickey-Fuller test where we use the default number of lags (amount of time-dependency) in our test. For a time-series of 100, this is 4.

Try a Dickey-Fuller test. This is testing with a null hypothesis of AR(1) stationarity versus a null hypothesis with AR(4) stationarity when we used the default k. tseries::adf.test(wn, k=0) Warning in tseries::adf.test(wn, k = 0): p-value smaller than printed p- value Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: wn Dickey-Fuller = -10.122, Lag order = 0, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Notice that the test-statistic is smaller. This is a more restrictive test and we can reject the null with a higher significance level. 5.3.3.2 Test on white noise with trend Try the test on white noise with a trend and intercept. intercept &lt;- 1 wnt &lt;- wn + 1:TT + intercept tseries::adf.test(wnt) Warning in tseries::adf.test(wnt): p-value smaller than printed p-value Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: wnt Dickey-Fuller = -4.8309, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary The null hypothesis is still rejected. adf.test() uses a model that allows an intercept and trend. 5.3.3.3 Test on random walk Let’s try the test on a random walk (nonstationary). rw &lt;- cumsum(rnorm(TT)) tseries::adf.test(rw) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: rw Dickey-Fuller = -2.3038, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.4508 alternative hypothesis: stationary The null hypothesis is NOT rejected as the p-value is greater than 0.05. Try a Dickey-Fuller test. tseries::adf.test(rw, k=0) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: rw Dickey-Fuller = -1.7921, Lag order = 0, p-value = 0.6627 alternative hypothesis: stationary Notice that the test-statistic is larger. 5.3.3.4 Test the anchovy data tseries::adf.test(anchovyts) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: anchovyts Dickey-Fuller = -1.6851, Lag order = 2, p-value = 0.6923 alternative hypothesis: stationary The p-value is greater than 0.05. We cannot reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is that the data are non-stationary. 5.3.4 ADF test using ur.df() The ur.df() Augmented Dickey-Fuller test in the urca package gives us a bit more information on and control over the test. ur.df(y, type = c(&quot;none&quot;, &quot;drift&quot;, &quot;trend&quot;), lags = 1, selectlags = c(&quot;Fixed&quot;, &quot;AIC&quot;, &quot;BIC&quot;)) The ur.df() function allows us to specify whether to test stationarity around a zero-mean with no trend, around a non-zero mean with no trend, or around a trend with an intercept. This can be useful when we know that our data have no trend, for example if you have removed the trend already. ur.df() allows us to specify the lags or select them using model selection. 5.3.4.1 Test on white noise Let’s first do the test on data we know is stationary, white noise. We have to choose the type and lags. If you have no particular reason to not include an intercept and trend, then use type=&quot;trend&quot;. This allows both intercept and trend. When you might you have a particular reason not to use &quot;trend&quot;? When you have removed the trend and/or intercept. Next you need to chose the lags. We will use lags=0 to do the Dickey-Fuller test. Note the number of lags you can test will depend on the amount of data that you have. adf.test() used a default of trunc((length(x)-1)^(1/3)) for the lags, but ur.df() requires that you pass in a value or use a fixed default of 1. lags=0 is fitting this model to the data. You are testing if the effect for z.lag.1 is 0. z.diff = gamma * z.lag.1 + intercept + trend * tt z.diff means \\(\\Delta y_t\\) and z.lag.1 is \\(y_{t-1}\\). When you use summary() for the output from ur.df(), you will see the estimated values for \\(\\gamma\\) (denoted z.lag.1), intercept and trend. If you see *** or ** on the coefficients list for z.lag.1, it indicates that the effect of z.lag.1 is significantly different than 0 and this supports the assumption of stationarity.

The \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) are parameters that are (potentially) estimated. The \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) are your data. The \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) are the hidden state(s). Everything in bold is a matrix; if it is a small bolded letter, it is a matrix with 1 column. Important: In the state-space model equation, \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is always the data and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is a hidden random walk estimated from the data. A basic MARSS() call looks like fit=MARSS(y, model=list(...)). The argument model tells the function what form the parameters take. The list has the elements with the names: B, U, Q, etc. The names correspond to the parameters with the same names in Equation (6.1) except that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) is called x0. tinitx indicates whether the initial \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is specified at \\(t=0\\) so \\(\\mathbf{x}_0\\) or \\(t=1\\) so \\(\\mathbf{x}_1\\). Here’s an example. Let’s say we want to fit a univariate AR(1) model observed with error.

Equation (6.1) is in MATRIX form. In the model list, the parameters must be written EXACTLY like they would be written for Equation (6.1). For example, 1 is the number 1 in R. It is not a matrix: class(1) [1] &quot;numeric&quot; If you need a 1 (or 0) in your model, you need to pass in the parameter as a \\(1 \\times 1\\) matrix: matrix(1). With that mind, our model list for Equation (6.2) is: mod.list &lt;- list( B=matrix(1), U=matrix(0), Q=matrix(&quot;q&quot;), Z=matrix(1), A=matrix(0), R=matrix(&quot;r&quot;), x0=matrix(&quot;mu&quot;), tinitx=0 ) We can simulate some AR(1) plus error data like so q &lt;- 0.1; r &lt;- 0.1; n &lt;- 100 y &lt;- cumsum(rnorm(n,0,sqrt(q)))+rnorm(n,0,sqrt(r)) And then fit with MARSS() using mod.list above: fit &lt;- MARSS(y, model=mod.list) Success! abstol and log-log tests passed at 16 iterations.

That is fine if you have a long data set, but would be disastrous for the short data sets typical in fisheries and ecology. StructTS() is much, much faster for long time series. The example in ?StructTS is pretty much instantaneous with StructTS() but takes minutes with the EM algorithm that is the default in MARSS(). With the BFGS algorithm, it is much closer to StructTS(): trees &lt;- window(treering, start = 0) fitts &lt;- StructTS(trees, type = &quot;level&quot;) fitem &lt;- MARSS(as.vector(trees),mod.nile.2) fitbf &lt;- MARSS(as.vector(trees),mod.nile.2, method=&quot;BFGS&quot;) Note that mod.nile.2 specifies a univariate stochastic level model so we can use it just fine with other univariate data sets. In addition, fitted(fit.sts) where fit.sts is a fit from StructTS() is very different than fit.marss$states from MARSS(). t=10 fitted(fit.sts)[t] [1] 1162.904 is the expected value of \\(y_{t+1}\\) (in this case \\(y_{11}\\) since we set \\(t=10\\)) given the data up to \\(y_t\\) (in this case, up to \\(y_{10}\\)). It is called the one-step ahead prediction. We are not going to use the one-step ahead predictions unless we are forecasting or doing cross-validation. Typically, when we analyze fisheries and ecological data, we want to know the estimate of the state, the \\(x_t\\), given ALL the data. For example, we might need an estimate of the population size in year 1990 given a time series of counts from 1930 to 2015. We don’t want to use only the data up to 1989; we want to use all the information. fit.marss$states from MARSS() is the expected value of \\(x_t\\) given all the data. For the stochastic level model, that is equal to the expected value of \\(y_t\\) given all the data except \\(y_t\\). If you needed the one-step predictions from MARSS(), you can get them from the Kalman filter output: kf=print(kem.2, what=&quot;kfs&quot;) kf$xtt1[1,t] Passing in what=&quot;kfs&quot; returns the Kalman filter/smoother output. The expected value of \\(x_t\\) conditioned on \\(y_1\\) to \\(y_{t-1}\\) is in kf$xtt1. The expected value of \\(x_t\\) conditioned on all the data is in kf$xtT. Figure 6.2: The Nile River flow volume with the model estimated flow rates (solid lines). The bottom model is a stochastic level model, meaning there isn’t one level line. Rather the level line is a distribution that has a mean and standard deviation. The solid state line in the bottom plots is the mean of the stochastic level and the 2 standard deviations are shown. The other two models are deterministic level models so the state is not stochastic and does not have a standard deviation. "],

Let’s put the AICc values 3 Nile models together: nile.aic = c(kem.0$AICc, kem.1$AICc, kem.2$AICc, kem.3$AICc) Then we calculate the AICc minus the minus AICc in our model set and compute the model weights. \\(\\Delta\\text{AIC}\\) is the AIC values minus the minimum AIC value in your model set. delAIC &lt;- nile.aic-min(nile.aic) relLik &lt;- exp(-0.5*delAIC) aicweight &lt;- relLik/sum(relLik) And this leads to our model weights table: aic.table &lt;- data.frame( AICc=nile.aic, delAIC=delAIC, relLik=relLik, weight=aicweight) rownames(aic.table) &lt;- c(&quot;flat level&quot;,&quot;linear trend&quot;, &quot;stoc level&quot;, &quot;stoc level w drift&quot;) Here the table is printed using round() to limit the number of digits shown. round(aic.table, digits=3) AICc delAIC relLik weight flat level 1313.155 31.379 0.000 0.000 linear trend 1290.882 9.106 0.011 0.007 stoc level 1281.776 0.000 1.000 0.647 stoc level w drift 1283.026 1.250 0.535 0.346 One thing to keep in mind when comparing models within a set of models is that the model set needs to include at least one model that can fit the data reasonably well. Reasonably well' means the model can put a fitted line through the data. Can't all models do that? Definitely, not. For example, the flat-level model cannot put a fitted line through the Nile River data. It is simply impossible. The straight trend model also cannot put a fitted line through the flow data. So if our model set only included flat-level and straight trend, then we might have said that the straight trend model isbest’ even though it is just the better of two bad models. "],
["sec-uss-basic-diagnostics.html", "6.5 Basic diagnostics", " 6.5 Basic diagnostics The first diagnostic that you do with any statistical analysis is check that your residuals correspond to your assumed error structure. We have two types of errors in a univariate state-space model: process errors, the \\(w_t\\), and observation errors, the \\(v_t\\). They should not have a temporal trend. To get the residuals from most types of fits in R, you can use residuals(fit). MARSS() calls the \\(v_t\\), “model residuals”, and the \\(w_t\\) “state residuals”. We can plot these using the following code (Figure 6.3). par(mfrow=c(1,2)) resids &lt;- residuals(kem.0) plot(resids$model.residuals[1,], ylab=&quot;model residual&quot;, xlab=&quot;&quot;, main=&quot;flat level&quot;) abline(h=0) plot(resids$state.residuals[1,], ylab=&quot;state residual&quot;, xlab=&quot;&quot;, main=&quot;flat level&quot;) abline(h=0) Figure 6.3: The model and state residuals for the first 3 models.

The stochastic level model looks the best in that its model residuals (the \\(v_t\\)) are fine but the state model still has problems. Clearly the state is not a simple random walk.

In this case, we need to pass in dat and the number of time steps since that is used in the for loop. We also specify the parameters that we want to monitor. We need to specify at least one, but we will monitor all of them so we can plot them after fitting.

Read the help file for the Arima() function (in the forecast package) if you are fuzzy on the arima notation. The MARSS package includes a data set of sharp-tailed grouse in Washington. Load the data to use as follows: library(MARSS) dat=log(grouse[,2]) Consider these two models for the data: Model 1 random walk with no drift observed with no error Model 2 random walk with drift observed with no error Written as a univariate state-space model, model 1 is \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} x_t = x_{t-1}+w_t \\text{ where } w_t \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,q)\\\\ x_0 = a \\\\ y_t = x_t \\end{gathered} \\tag{6.13} \\end{equation}\\] Model 2 is almost identical except with \\(u\\) added \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} x_t = x_{t-1}+u+w_t \\text{ where } w_t \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,q)\\\\ x_0 = a \\\\ y_t = x_t \\end{gathered} \\tag{6.14} \\end{equation}\\] \\(y\\) is the log grouse count in year \\(t\\). Plot the data. The year is in column 1 of grouse. Fit each model using MARSS(). Which one appears better supported given AICc? Load the forecast package. Use ?auto.arima to learn what it does. Then use auto.arima(dat) to fit the data. Next run auto.arima(dat, trace=TRUE) to see all the ARIMA models that the function compared. Note, ARIMA(0,1,0) is a random walk with b=1. ARIMA(0,1,0) with drift would be a random walk (b=1) with drift (with \\(u\\)). Is the difference in the AICc values between a random walk with and without drift comparable between MARSS() and auto.arima()? Note when using auto.arima(), an AR(1) model of the following form will be fit (notice the \\(b\\)): \\(x_t = b x_{t-1}+w_t\\). auto.arima() refers to this model \\(x_t = x_{t-1}+w_t\\), which is also AR(1) but with \\(b=1\\), as ARIMA(0,1,0). This says that the first difference of the data (that’s the 1 in the middle) is a ARMA(0,0) process (the 0s in the 1st and 3rd spots). So ARIMA(0,1,0) means this: \\(x_t - x_{t-1} = w_t\\). Create a random walk with drift time series using cumsum() and rnorm(). Look at the rnorm() help file (?rnorm) to make sure you know what the arguments to the rnorm() are. dat &lt;- cumsum(rnorm(100,0.1,1)) What is the order of this random walk written as ARIMA(p, d, q)? “what is the order” means “what is \\(p\\), \\(d\\), and \\(q\\). Model”order&quot; is how arima() and Arima() specify arima models. Fit that model using Arima() in the forecast package. You’ll need to specify the arguments order and include.drift. Use ?Arima to review what that function does if needed. Write out the equation for this random walk as a univariate state-space model. Notice that there is no observation error, but still write this as a state-space model. Fit that model with MARSS(). How are the two estimates from Arima() and MARSS() different? The first-difference of dat used in the previous problem is: diff.dat=diff(dat) Use ?diff to check what the diff() function does. If \\(x_t\\) denotes a time series. What is the first difference of \\(x\\)? What is the second difference? What is the \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) model for diff.dat? Look at your answer to part (a) and the answer to part (e). Fit diff.dat using Arima(). You’ll need to change the arguments order and include.mean. Fit with MARSS(). You will need to write the model for diff.dat as a state-space model. If you’ve done this right, the estimated parameters using Arima() and MARSS() will now be the same. This question should clue you into the fact that Arima() is not exactly fitting Equation (6.1). It’s very similar, but not quite written that way. By the way, Equation (6.1) is how structural time series observed with error are written (state-space models). To recover the estimates that a function like arima() or Arima() returns, you need to write your state-space model in a specific way (as seen above). Arima() will also fit what it calls an “AR(1) with drift”. An AR(1) with drift is NOT this model: \\[\\begin{equation} x_t = b x_{t-1}+u+w_t \\text{ where } w_t \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,q) \\tag{6.15} \\end{equation}\\] In the population dynamics literature, this equation is called the Gompertz model and is a type of density-dependent population model. Write R code to simulate Equation (6.15). Make \\(b\\) less than 1 and greater than 0. Set \\(u\\) and \\(x_0\\) to whatever you want. You can use a for loop. Plot the trajectories and show that this model does not “drift” upward or downward. It fluctuates about a mean value. Hold \\(b\\) constant and change \\(u\\). How do the trajectories change? Hold \\(u\\) constant and change \\(b\\). Make sure to use a \\(b\\) close to 1 and another close to 0. How do the trajectories change? Do 2 simulations each with the same \\(w_t\\). In one simulation, set \\(u=1\\) and in the other \\(u=2\\). For both simulations, set \\(x_1 = u/(1-b)\\). You can set \\(b\\) to whatever you want as long as \\(0&lt;b&lt;1\\). Plot the 2 trajectories on the same plot. What is different? We will fit what Arima() calls “AR(1) with drift” models in the chapter on MARSS models with covariates. The MARSS package includes a data set of gray whales. Load the data to use as follows: library(MARSS) dat &lt;- log(graywhales[,2]) Fit a random walk with drift model observed with error to the data: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} x_t = x_{t-1}+u+w_t \\text{ where } w_t \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,q) \\\\ y_t = x_t+v_t \\text{ where } v_t \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,r) \\\\ x_0 = a \\end{gathered} \\tag{6.16} \\end{equation}\\] \\(y\\) is the whale count in year \\(t\\). \\(x\\) is interpreted as the ‘true’ unknown population size that we are trying to estimate. Fit this model with MARSS() Plot the estimated \\(x\\) as a line with the actual counts added as points. \\(x\\) is in fit$states. It is a matrix. To plot using plot(), you will need to change it to a vector using as.vector() or fit$states[1,] Simulate 1000 sample gray whale populstion trajectories (the \\(x\\) in your model) using the estimated \\(u\\) and \\(q\\) starting at the estimated \\(x\\) in 1997. You can do this with a couple for loops or write something terse with cumsum() and apply(). Using these simulated trajectories, what is your estimate of the probability that the grey whale population will be above 50,000 graywhales in 2007? What kind(s) of uncertainty does your estimate above NOT include? Fit the following models to the graywhales data using MARSS(). Assume \\(b=1\\). Model 1 Process error only model with drift Model 2 Process error only model without drift Model 3 Process error with drift and observation error with observation error variance fixed = 0.05. Model 4 Process error with drift and observation error with observation error variance estimated. Compute the AICc’s for each model and likelihood or deviance (-2 * log likelihood). Where to find these? Try names(fit). logLik() is the standard R function to return log-likelihood from fits. Calculate a table of \\(\\Delta\\text{AICc}\\) values and AICc weights. Show the acf of the model and state residuals for the best model. You will need a vector of the residuals to do this. If fit is the fit from a fit call like fit = MARSS(dat), you get the residuals using this code: residuals(fit)$state.residuals[1,] residuals(fit)$model.residuals[1,] Do the acf’s suggest any problems? Evaluate the predictive accuracy of forecasts using the forecast package using the airmiles dataset. Load the data to use as follows: library(forecast) dat &lt;- log(airmiles) n &lt;- length(dat) training.dat &lt;- dat[1:(n-3)] test.dat &lt;- dat[(n-2):n] This will prepare the training data and set aside the last 3 data points for validation. Fit the following four models using Arima(): ARIMA(0,0,0), ARIMA(1,0,0), ARIMA(0,0,1), ARIMA(1,0,1). Use forecast() to make 3 step ahead forecasts from each. Calculate the MASE statistic for each using the accuracy() function in the forecast package. Type ?accuracy to learn how to use this function. Present the results in a table. Which model is best supported based on the MASE statistic? The WhaleNet Archive of STOP Data has movement data on loggerhead turtles on the east coast of the US from ARGOS tags. The MARSS package loggerheadNoisy dataset is lat/lot data on eight individuals, however we have corrupted this data severely by adding random errors in order to create a “bad tag” problem (very noisy). Use head(loggerheadNoisy) to get an idea of the data. Then load the data on one turtle, MaryLee. MARSS needs time across the columns to you need to use transpose the data (as shown). turtlename &lt;- &quot;MaryLee&quot; dat &lt;- loggerheadNoisy[which(loggerheadNoisy$turtle==turtlename),5:6] dat &lt;- t(dat) Plot MaryLee’s locations (as a line not dots). Put the latitude locations on the y-axis and the longitude on the y-axis. You can use rownames(dat) to see which is in which row. You can just use plot() for the homework. But if you want, you can look at the MARSS Manual chapter on animal movement to see how to plot the turtle locations on a map using the maps package. Analyze the data with a state-space model (movement observed with error) using fit0 &lt;- MARSS(dat) Look at the output from the above MARSS call. What is the meaning of the parameters output from MARSS in terms of turtle movement? What exactly is the \\(u\\) estimate for example? Look at the data and think about the model you fit. What assumption did the default MARSS model make about observation error and process error? What does that assumption mean in terms of how steps in the N-S and E-W directions are related? What does that assumption mean in terms of our assumption about the latitudal and longitudinal observation errors? Does MaryLee move faster in the latitude direction versus longitude direction? Add MaryLee’s estimated “true” positions to your plot of her locations. You can use lines(x, y, col=&quot;red&quot;) (with x and y replaced with your x and y data). The true position is the “state”. This is in the states element of an output from MARSS fit0$states. Fit the following models with different assumptions regarding the movement in the lat/lon direction: Lat/lon movements are independent but the variance is the same Lat/lon movements are correlated and lat/lon variances are different Lat/lon movements are correlated and the lat/lon variances are the same. You only need to change Q specification. Your MARSS call will now look like the following with ... replaced with your Q specification. fit1 &lt;- MARSS(dat, list(Q=...)) Plot your state residuals (true location residuals). What are the problems? Discuss in reference to your plot of the location data. Here is how to get state residuals from MARSS() output: resids &lt;- residuals(fit0)$state.residuals The lon residuals are in row 1 and lat residuals are in row 2 (same order as the data). "],

["sec-mss-west-coast-harbor-seals-counts.html", "7.2 West coast harbor seals counts", " 7.2 West coast harbor seals counts In this example, we will use multivariate state-space models to combine surveys from four survey regions to estimate the average long-term population growth rate and the year-to-year variability in that population growth rate. We have five regions (or sites) where harbor seals were censused from 1978-1999 while hauled out of land. During the period of this dataset, harbor seals were recovering steadily after having been reduced to low levels by hunting prior to protection. We will assume that the underlying population process is a stochastic exponential growth process with mean rates of increase that were not changing through 1978-1999. The survey methodologies were consistent throughout the 20 years of the data but we do not know what fraction of the population that each region represents nor do we know the observation-error variance for each region. Given differences between the numbers of haul-outs in each region, the observation errors may be quite different. The regions have had different levels of sampling; the best sampled region has only 4 years missing while the worst has over half the years missing (Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1: Plot of the of the count data from the five harbor seal regions (Jeffries et al. 2003). The numbers on each line denote the different regions: 1) Strait of Juan de Fuca (SJF), 2) San Juan Islands (SJI), 2) Eastern Bays (EBays), 4) Puget Sound (PSnd), and 5) Hood Canal (HC). Each region is an index of the total harbor seal population in each region. 7.2.1 Load the harbor seal data The harbor seal data are included in the MARSS package as matrix with years in column 1 and the logged counts in the other columns. Let’s look at the first few years of data: data(harborSealWA, package=&quot;MARSS&quot;) print(harborSealWA[1:8,], digits=3) Year SJF SJI EBays PSnd HC [1,] 1978 6.03 6.75 6.63 5.82 6.6 [2,] 1979 NA NA NA NA NA [3,] 1980 NA NA NA NA NA [4,] 1981 NA NA NA NA NA [5,] 1982 NA NA NA NA NA [6,] 1983 6.78 7.43 7.21 NA NA [7,] 1984 6.93 7.74 7.45 NA NA [8,] 1985 7.16 7.53 7.26 6.60 NA We are going to leave out Hood Canal (HC) since that region is somewhat isolated from the others and experiencing very different conditions due to hypoxic events and periodic intense killer whale predation.

["sec-mss-a-single-well-mixed-population.html", "7.3 A single well-mixed population", " 7.3 A single well-mixed population When we are looking at data over a large geographic region, we might make the assumption that the different census regions are measuring a single population if we think animals are moving sufficiently such that the whole area (multiple regions together) is “well-mixed”. We write a model of the total population abundance for this case as: \\[\\begin{equation} n_t = \\,\\text{exp}(u + w_t) n_{t-1}, \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n_t\\) is the total count in year \\(t\\), \\(u\\) is the mean population growth rate, and \\(w_t\\) is the deviation from that average in year \\(t\\). We then take the log of both sides and write the model in log space: \\[\\begin{equation} x_t = x_{t-1} + u + w_t, \\textrm{ where } w_t \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,q) \\tag{7.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\(x_t=\\log{n_t}\\). When there is one effective population, there is one \\(x\\), therefore \\(\\mathbf{x}_t\\) is a \\(1 \\times 1\\) matrix. This is our state model and \\(x\\) is called the “state”. This is just the jargon used in this type of model (state-space model) for the hidden state that you are estimating from the data. “Hidden” means that you observe this state with error. 7.3.1 The observation process We assume that all four regional time series are observations of this one population trajectory but they are scaled up or down relative to that trajectory. In effect, we think of each regional survey as an index of the total population. With this model, we do not think the regions represent independent subpopulations but rather independent observations of one population. Our model for the data, \\(\\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{Z} \\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}_t\\), is written as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} y_{1} \\\\ y_{2} \\\\ y_{3} \\\\ y_{4} \\end{array} \\right]_t = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\\\ 1\\end{array} \\right] x_t + \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\\\ a_4 \\end{array} \\right] + \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\\\ v_{3} \\\\ v_{4} \\end{array} \\right]_t \\tag{7.4} \\end{equation}\\] Each \\(y_{i}\\) is the observed time series of counts for a different region. The \\(a\\)’s are the bias between the regional sample and the total population. \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) specifies which observation time series, \\(y_i\\), is associated with which population trajectory, \\(x_j\\). In this case, \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is a matrix with 1 column since each region is an observation of the one population trajectory. We allow that each region could have a unique observation variance and that the observation errors are independent between regions. We assume that the observations errors on log(counts) are normal and thus the errors on (counts) are log-normal. The assumption of normality is not unreasonable since these regional counts are the sum of counts across multiple haul-outs. We specify independent observation errors with different variances by specifying that \\(\\mathbf{v} \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{R})\\), where \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{R} = \\begin{bmatrix} r_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; r_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; r_3 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; r_4 \\end{bmatrix} \\tag{7.5} \\end{equation}\\] This is a diagonal matrix with unequal variances. The shortcut for this structure in MARSS() is &quot;diagonal and unequal&quot;. 7.3.2 Fitting the model We need to write the model in the form of Equation (7.1) with each parameter written as a matrix. The observation model (Equation (7.4)) is already in matrix form. Let’s write the state model in matrix form too: \\[\\begin{equation} [x]_t = [1][x]_{t-1} + [u] + [w]_t, \\textrm{ where } [w]_t \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,[q]) \\tag{7.6} \\end{equation}\\] It is very simple since all terms are \\(1 \\times 1\\) matrices. To fit our model with MARSS(), we set up a list which precisely describes the size and structure of each parameter matrix. Fixed values in a matrix are designated with their numeric value and estimated values are given a character name and put in quotes. Our model list for a single well-mixed population is: mod.list.0 &lt;- list( B=matrix(1), U=matrix(&quot;u&quot;), Q=matrix(&quot;q&quot;), Z=matrix(1,4,1), A=&quot;scaling&quot;, R=&quot;diagonal and unequal&quot;, x0=matrix(&quot;mu&quot;), tinitx=0 ) and fit: fit.0 &lt;- MARSS(dat, model=mod.list.0) Success! abstol and log-log tests passed at 32 iterations.

["sec-mss-segind.html", "7.4 Four subpopulations with temporally uncorrelated errors", " 7.4 Four subpopulations with temporally uncorrelated errors The model for one well-mixed population was not very good. Another reasonable assumption is that the different census regions are measuring four different temporally independent subpopulations.

This means that the process variance (variance in year-to-year population growth rates) is independent (good and bad years are not correlated) but the level of variability is the same across regions. We made the \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) matrix with one \\(u\\) value. This means that we assume the population growth rates are the same across regions. Notice that we set the \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) matrix equal to a diagonal matrix with 1 on the diagonal. This is the “identity” matrix and it is like a 1 but for matrices. We do not need \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) for our model, but MARSS() requires a value. 7.4.1 The observation process In this model, each survey is an observation of a different \\(x\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} y_{1} \\\\ y_{2} \\\\ y_{3} \\\\ y_{4} \\end{array} \\right]_t = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\x_3\\\\x_4\\end{bmatrix}_t + \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right] + \\left[ \\begin{array}{c} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\\\ v_{3} \\\\ v_{4} \\end{array} \\right]_t \\tag{7.8} \\end{equation}\\] No \\(a\\)’s can be estimated since we do not have multiple observations of a given \\(x\\) time series. Our \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) matrix doesn’t change; the observation errors are still assumed to the independent with different variances. Notice that our \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) matrix changed. \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is specifying which \\(y_i\\) goes to which \\(x_j\\). The one we have specified means that \\(y_1\\) is observing \\(x_1\\), \\(y_2\\) observes \\(x_2\\), etc. We could have set up \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) like so \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] This would mean that \\(y_1\\) observes \\(x_2\\), \\(y_2\\) observes \\(x_1\\), \\(y_3\\) observes \\(x_4\\), and \\(y_4\\) observes \\(x_3\\). Which \\(x\\) goes to which \\(y\\) is arbitrary; we need to make sure it is one-to-one. We will stay with \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) as an identity matrix since \\(y_i\\) observing \\(x_i\\) makes it easier to remember which \\(x\\) goes with which \\(y\\). 7.4.2 Fitting the model We set up the model list for MARSS() as: mod.list.1 &lt;- list( B=&quot;identity&quot;, U=&quot;equal&quot;, Q=&quot;diagonal and equal&quot;, Z=&quot;identity&quot;, A=&quot;scaling&quot;, R=&quot;diagonal and unequal&quot;, x0=&quot;unequal&quot;, tinitx=0 ) We introduced a few more short-cuts. &quot;equal&quot; means all the values in the matrix are the same. &quot;diagonal and equal&quot; means that the matrix is diagonal with one value on the diagonal. &quot;unequal&quot; means that all values in the matrix are different. We can then fit our model for 4 subpopulations as: fit.1 &lt;- MARSS::MARSS(dat, model=mod.list.1) "],

["sec-msscov-season.html", "8.6 Including seasonal effects in MARSS models", " 8.6 Including seasonal effects in MARSS models Time-series data are often collected at intervals with some implicit ``seasonality.’’ For example, quarterly earnings for a business, monthly rainfall totals, or hourly air temperatures. In those cases, it is often helpful to extract any recurring seasonal patterns that might otherwise mask some of the other temporal dynamics we are interested in examining. Here we show a few approaches for including seasonal effects using the Lake Washington plankton data, which were collected monthly. The following examples will use all five phytoplankton species from Lake Washington. First, let’s set up the data. years &lt;- fulldat[,&quot;Year&quot;]&gt;=1965 &amp; fulldat[,&quot;Year&quot;]&lt;1975 phytos &lt;- c(&quot;Diatoms&quot;, &quot;Greens&quot;, &quot;Bluegreens&quot;, &quot;Unicells&quot;, &quot;Other.algae&quot;) dat &lt;- t(fulldat[years, phytos]) # z.score data because we changed the mean when we subsampled the.mean &lt;- apply(dat,1,mean,na.rm=TRUE) the.sigma &lt;- sqrt(apply(dat,1,var,na.rm=TRUE)) dat &lt;- (dat-the.mean)*(1/the.sigma) # number of time periods/samples TT &lt;- dim(dat)[2] 8.6.1 Seasonal effects as fixed factors One common approach for estimating seasonal effects is to treat each one as a fixed factor, such that the number of parameters equals the number of ``seasons’’ (e.g., 24 hours per day, 4 quarters per year). The plankton data are collected monthly, so we will treat each month as a fixed factor. To fit a model with fixed month effects, we create a \\(12 \\times T\\) covariate matrix \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) with one row for each month (Jan, Feb, …) and one column for each time point. We put a 1 in the January row for each column corresponding to a January time point, a 1 in the February row for each column corresponding to a February time point, and so on. All other values of \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) equal 0. The following code will create such a \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) matrix. # number of &quot;seasons&quot; (e.g., 12 months per year) period &lt;- 12 # first &quot;season&quot; (e.g., Jan = 1, July = 7) per.1st &lt;- 1 # create factors for seasons c.in &lt;- diag(period) for(i in 2:(ceiling(TT/period))) {c.in &lt;- cbind(c.in,diag(period))} # trim c.in to correct start &amp; length c.in &lt;- c.in[,(1:TT)+(per.1st-1)] # better row names rownames(c.in) &lt;- month.abb Next we need to set up the form of the \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) matrix which defines any constraints we want to set on the month effects. \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is a \\(5 \\times 12\\) matrix. Five taxon and 12 month effects. If we wanted each taxon to have the same month effect, i.e. there is a common month effect across all taxon, then we have the same value in each \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) column: C &lt;- matrix(month.abb,5,12,byrow=TRUE) C [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [1,] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; [2,] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; [3,] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; [4,] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; [5,] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; [,12] [1,] &quot;Dec&quot; [2,] &quot;Dec&quot; [3,] &quot;Dec&quot; [4,] &quot;Dec&quot; [5,] &quot;Dec&quot; Notice, that \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) only has 12 values in it, the 12 common month effects. However, for this example, we will let each taxon have a different month effect thus allowing different seasonality for each taxon. For this model, we want each value in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to be unique: C &lt;- &quot;unconstrained&quot; Now \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) has 5 \\(\\times\\) 12 = 60 separate effects. Then we set up the form for the rest of the model parameters. We make the following assumptions: # Each taxon has unique density-dependence B &lt;- &quot;diagonal and unequal&quot; # Assume independent process errors Q &lt;- &quot;diagonal and unequal&quot; # We have demeaned the data &amp; are fitting a mean-reverting model # by estimating a diagonal B, thus U &lt;- &quot;zero&quot; # Each obs time series is associated with only one process Z &lt;- &quot;identity&quot; # The data are demeaned &amp; fluctuate around a mean A &lt;- &quot;zero&quot; # We assume observation errors are independent, but they # have similar variance due to similar collection methods R &lt;- &quot;diagonal and equal&quot; # We are not including covariate effects in the obs equation D &lt;- &quot;zero&quot; d &lt;- &quot;zero&quot; Now we can set up the model list for MARSS and fit the model (results are not shown since they are verbose with 60 different month effects). model.list &lt;- list(B=B,U=U,Q=Q,Z=Z,A=A,R=R,C=C,c=c.in,D=D,d=d) seas.mod.1 &lt;- MARSS(dat,model=model.list,control=list(maxit=1500)) # Get the estimated seasonal effects # rows are taxa, cols are seasonal effects seas.1 &lt;- coef(seas.mod.1,type=&quot;matrix&quot;)$C rownames(seas.1) &lt;- phytos colnames(seas.1) &lt;- month.abb The top panel in Figure 8.2 shows the estimated seasonal effects for this model. Note that if we had set U=“unequal”, we would need to set one of the columns of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to zero because the model would be under-determined (infinite number of solutions). If we substracted the mean January abundance off each time series, we could set the January column in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to 0 and get rid of 5 estimated effects. 8.6.2 Seasonal effects as a polynomial The fixed factor approach required estimating 60 effects. Another approach is to model the month effect as a 3rd-order (or higher) polynomial: \\(a+b\\times m + c\\times m^2 + d \\times m^3\\) where \\(m\\) is the month number. This approach has less flexibility but requires only 20 estimated parameters (i.e., 4 regression parameters times 5 taxa). To do so, we create a \\(4 \\times T\\) covariate matrix \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) with the rows corresponding to 1, \\(m\\), \\(m^2\\), and \\(m^3\\), and the columns again corresponding to the time points. Here is how to set up this matrix: # number of &quot;seasons&quot; (e.g., 12 months per year) period &lt;- 12 # first &quot;season&quot; (e.g., Jan = 1, July = 7) per.1st &lt;- 1 # order of polynomial poly.order &lt;- 3 # create polynomials of months month.cov &lt;- matrix(1,1,period) for(i in 1:poly.order) {month.cov = rbind(month.cov,(1:12)^i)} # our c matrix is month.cov replicated once for each year c.m.poly &lt;- matrix(month.cov, poly.order+1, TT+period, byrow=FALSE) # trim c.in to correct start &amp; length c.m.poly &lt;- c.m.poly[,(1:TT)+(per.1st-1)] # Everything else remains the same as in the previous example model.list &lt;- list(B=B,U=U,Q=Q,Z=Z,A=A,R=R,C=C,c=c.m.poly,D=D,d=d) seas.mod.2 &lt;- MARSS(dat, model=model.list, control=list(maxit=1500)) The effect of month \\(m\\) for taxon \\(i\\) is \\(a_i + b_i \\times m + c_i \\times m^2 + d_i \\times m^3\\), where \\(a_i\\), \\(b_i\\), \\(c_i\\) and \\(d_i\\) are in the \\(i\\)-th row of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\). We can now calculate the matrix of seasonal effects as follows, where each row is a taxon and each column is a month: C.2 = coef(seas.mod.2,type=&quot;matrix&quot;)$C seas.2 = C.2 %*% month.cov rownames(seas.2) &lt;- phytos colnames(seas.2) &lt;- month.abb The middle panel in Figure 8.2 shows the estimated seasonal effects for this polynomial model. Note: Setting the covariates up like this means that our covariates are collinear since \\(m\\), \\(m^2\\) and \\(m^3\\) are correlated, obviously.

A third option is to use a discrete Fourier series, which is combination of sine and cosine waves; it would require only 10 parameters. Specifically, the effect of month \\(m\\) on taxon \\(i\\) is \\(a_i \\times \\cos(2 \\pi m/p) + b_i \\times \\sin(2 \\pi m/p)\\), where \\(p\\) is the period (e.g., 12 months, 4 quarters), and \\(a_i\\) and \\(b_i\\) are contained in the \\(i\\)-th row of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\). We begin by defining the \\(2 \\times T\\) seasonal covariate matrix \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) as a combination of 1 cosine and 1 sine wave: cos.t &lt;- cos(2 * pi * seq(TT) / period) sin.t &lt;- sin(2 * pi * seq(TT) / period) c.Four &lt;- rbind(cos.t,sin.t) Everything else remains the same and we can fit this model as follows: model.list &lt;- list(B=B,U=U,Q=Q,Z=Z,A=A,R=R,C=C,c=c.Four,D=D,d=d) seas.mod.3 &lt;- MARSS(dat, model=model.list, control=list(maxit=1500)) We make our seasonal effect matrix as follows: C.3 &lt;- coef(seas.mod.3, type=&quot;matrix&quot;)$C # The time series of net seasonal effects seas.3 &lt;- C.3 %*% c.Four[,1:period] rownames(seas.3) &lt;- phytos colnames(seas.3) &lt;- month.abb The bottom panel in Figure 8.2 shows the estimated seasonal effects for this seasonal-effects model based on a discrete Fourier series. Figure 8.2: Estimated monthly effects for the three approaches to estimating seasonal effects. Top panel: each month modelled as a separate fixed effect for each taxon (60 parameters); Middle panel: monthly effects modelled as a 3rd order polynomial (20 parameters); Bottom panel: monthly effects modelled as a discrete Fourier series (10 parameters). Rather than rely on our eyes to judge model fits, we should formally assess which of the 3 approaches offers the most parsimonious fit to the data. Here is a table of AICc values for the 3 models: data.frame(Model=c(&quot;Fixed&quot;, &quot;Cubic&quot;, &quot;Fourier&quot;), AICc=round(c(seas.mod.1$AICc, seas.mod.2$AICc, seas.mod.3$AICc),1)) Model AICc 1 Fixed 1188.4 2 Cubic 1144.9 3 Fourier 1127.4 The model selection results indicate that the model with monthly seasonal effects estimated via the discrete Fourier sequence is the best of the 3 models. Its AICc value is much lower than either the polynomial or fixed-effects models. "],

Assume that the observation errors are independent and identically distributed. You can further assume that any process errors are independent from one another, but the variances differ by taxon. Assume that each group is an observation of its own process. This means Z=&quot;identity&quot;. Use B=&quot;diagonal and unequal&quot;. This implies that each of the taxa are operating under varying degrees of density-dependence, and that they do not interact with any of the other taxa. All the data have been de-meaned and \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) identity, therefore use U=&quot;zero&quot; and A=&quot;zero&quot;. Make sure to check that the means of the data are 0 and the variance is 1. Use tinitx=0 (the default). Do not change to tinitx=1. You can try it to see what happens but answer the questions with tinitx=0. Normally, tinitx=1 will make your models fit more easily when you are estimating \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), but in this case it causes a problem. Why does the \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) tend to go to zero when tinitx=1 for the models we are fitting? Include a plot of residuals versus time and acf of residuals for each question. You only need to show these for the top (best) model if the question involves comparing multiple models. Use AICc to compare models. Some of the models do not converge, however use for the purpose of the homework, use the unconverged models. Thus use the output from MARSS() without any additional arguments. If you want, you can try using control=list(maxit=1000) to increase the number of iterations. Or you can try method=&quot;BFGS&quot; in your MARSS() call. This will use the BFGS optimization method, however it may throw an error for these data. "],

Use your raw data in the MARSS model. You do not need to difference the data to get at the growth rates since the process model is modeling that. How does month affect the mean phytoplankton population growth rates? Show a plot of mean growth rate versus month. Estimate seasonal effects without any covariate (Temp, TP) effects. It is likely that both temperature and total phosphorus (TP) affect phytoplankton population growth rates. Using MARSS models, evaluate which is the more important driver or if both are important. Leave out the seasonal covariates from question 1, i.e. only use Temp and TP as covariates. Evaluate whether the effect of temperature on phytoplankton manifests itself via their underlying physiology (by affecting algal growth rates and thus abundance) or because physical changes in the water stratification makes them easier/harder to sample in some months. Leave out the seasonal covariates from question 1, i.e. only use Temp and TP as covariates. Is there support for temperature or TP affecting all functional groups’ growth rates the same, or are the effects on one taxon different from another? Compare your results for questions 2-4 using an observation error only model, by using the lm() function. Then compare to a observation error only model with autocorrelated residuals using the Arima() function with the xreg argument. Compute a time-series cross-validation metric for the models and compare the results that you got using AICc for model comparison. "],
["chap-dlm-dynamic-linear-models.html", "Chapter 9 Dynamic linear models", " Chapter 9 Dynamic linear models Dynamic linear models (DLMs) are a type of linear regression model, wherein the parameters are treated as time-varying rather than static. DLMs are used commonly in econometrics, but have received less attention in the ecological literature (c.f. Lamon, Carpenter, and Stow 1998; Scheuerell and Williams 2005). Our treatment of DLMs is rather cursory—we direct the reader to excellent textbooks by Pole, West, and Harrison (1994) and Petris, Petrone, and Campagnoli (2009) for more in-depth treatments of DLMs. The former focuses on Bayesian estimation whereas the latter addresses both likelihood-based and Bayesian estimation methods.

["sec-dlm-overview.html", "9.1 Overview", " 9.1 Overview We begin our description of DLMs with a static regression model, wherein the \\(i^{th}\\) observation (response variable) is a linear function of an intercept, predictor variable(s), and a random error term. For example, if we had one predictor variable (\\(f\\)), we could write the model as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.1} y_i = \\alpha + \\beta f_i + v_i, \\end{equation}\\] where the \\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept, \\(\\beta\\) is the regression slope, \\(f_i\\) is the predictor variable matched to the \\(i^{th}\\) observation (\\(y_i\\)), and \\(v_i \\sim \\text{N}(0,r)\\). It is important to note here that there is no implicit ordering of the index \\(i\\). That is, we could shuffle any/all of the \\((y_i, f_i)\\) pairs in our dataset with no effect on our ability to estimate the model parameters. We can write Equation (9.1) using matrix notation, as \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{9.2} y_i &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;f_i\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha\\\\ \\beta\\end{bmatrix} + v_i \\nonumber\\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{F}_i^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\theta} + v_i, \\end{align}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{F}_i^{\\top} = \\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;f_i\\end{bmatrix}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha\\\\ \\beta\\end{bmatrix}\\). In a DLM, however, the regression parameters are dynamic in that they “evolve” over time. For a single observation at time \\(t\\), we can write \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.3} y_t = \\mathbf{F}_{t}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t + v_t, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{F}_t\\) is a column vector of predictor variables (covariates) at time \\(t\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t\\) is a column vector of regression parameters at time \\(t\\) and \\(v_{t}\\sim\\,\\text{N}(0,r)\\). This formulation presents two features that distinguish it from Equation (9.2). First, the observed data are explicitly time ordered (i.e., \\(\\mathbf{y}=\\lbrace{y_1,y_2,y_3,\\dots,y_T}\\rbrace\\)), which means we expect them to contain implicit information. Second, the relationship between the observed datum and the predictor variables are unique at every time \\(t\\) (i.e., \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\lbrace{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_2,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_3,\\dots,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_T}\\rbrace\\)). However, closer examination of Equation (9.3) reveals an apparent complication for parameter estimation. With only one datum at each time step \\(t\\), we could, at best, estimate only one regression parameter, and even then, the 1:1 correspondence between data and parameters would preclude any estimation of parameter uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we return to the time ordering of model parameters. Rather than assume the regression parameters are independent from one time step to another, we instead model them as an autoregressive process where \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.4} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t = \\mathbf{G}_t\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{w}_t, \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\mathbf{G}_t\\) is the parameter “evolution” matrix, and \\(\\mathbf{w}_t\\) is a vector of process errors, such that \\(\\mathbf{w}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{Q})\\). The elements of \\(\\mathbf{G}_t\\) may be known and fixed a priori, or unknown and estimated from the data. Although we could allow \\(\\mathbf{G}_t\\) to be time-varying, we will typically assume that it is time invariant or assume \\(\\mathbf{G}_t\\) is an \\(m \\times m\\) identity matrix \\(\\mathbf{I}_m\\). The idea is that the evolution matrix \\(\\mathbf{G}_t\\) deterministically maps the parameter space from one time step to the next, so the parameters at time \\(t\\) are temporally related to those before and after. However, the process is corrupted by stochastic error, which amounts to a degradation of information over time. If the diagonal elements of \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) are relatively large, then the parameters can vary widely from \\(t\\) to \\(t+1\\). If \\(\\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{0}\\), then \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_2=\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_T\\) and we are back to the static model in Equation (9.1). "],

["sec-dlm-salmon-example.html", "9.6 Analysis of salmon survival", " 9.6 Analysis of salmon survival Let’s see an example of a DLM used to analyze real data from the literature. Scheuerell and Williams (2005) used a DLM to examine the relationship between marine survival of Chinook salmon and an index of ocean upwelling strength along the west coast of the USA. Upwelling brings cool, nutrient-rich waters from the deep ocean to shallower coastal areas. Scheuerell &amp; Williams hypothesized that stronger upwelling in April should create better growing conditions for phytoplankton, which would then translate into more zooplankton. In turn, juvenile salmon (“smolts”) entering the ocean in May and June should find better foraging opportunities. Thus, for smolts entering the ocean in year \\(t\\), \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.20} survival_t = \\alpha_t + \\beta_t f_t + v_t \\text{ with } v_{t}\\sim\\,\\text{N}(0,r), \\end{equation}\\] and \\(f_t\\) is the coastal upwelling index (cubic meters of seawater per second per 100 m of coastline) for the month of April in year \\(t\\). Both the intercept and slope are time varying, so \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{9.21} \\alpha_t &amp;= \\alpha_{t-1} + w_{\\alpha,t} \\text{ with } w_{\\alpha,t} \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,q_{\\alpha})\\\\ \\beta_t &amp;= \\beta_{t-1} + w_{\\beta,t} \\text{ with } w_{\\beta,t} \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,q_{\\beta}). \\end{align}\\] If we define \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t = \\begin{bmatrix}\\alpha \\\\ \\beta\\end{bmatrix}_t\\), \\(\\mathbf{G}_t = \\mathbf{I}\\), \\(\\mathbf{w}_t = \\begin{bmatrix} w_\\alpha \\\\ w_\\beta\\end{bmatrix}_t\\), and \\(\\mathbf{Q} = \\begin{bmatrix}q_\\alpha&amp; 0 \\\\ 0&amp;q_\\beta\\end{bmatrix}\\), we get Equation (9.4). If we define \\(y_t = survival_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{F}_t = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ f_t\\end{bmatrix}\\), we can write out the full DLM as a state-space model with the following form: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.22} y_t = \\mathbf{F}_t^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t + v_t \\text{ with } v_t\\sim\\,\\text{N}(0,r)\\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t = \\mathbf{G}_t\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{w}_t \\text{ with } \\mathbf{w}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{Q})\\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0 = \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_0. \\end{equation}\\] Equation (9.22) is equivalent to our standard MARSS model: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.23} \\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{Z}_t\\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}_t \\text{ with } \\mathbf{v}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{R}_t)\\\\ \\mathbf{x}_t = \\mathbf{B}_t\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}_t \\text{ with } \\mathbf{w}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{Q}_t)\\\\ \\mathbf{x}_0 = \\boldsymbol{\\pi} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{x}_t = \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t\\), \\(\\mathbf{B}_t = \\mathbf{G}_t\\), \\(\\mathbf{y}_t = y_t\\) (i.e., \\(\\mathbf{y}_t\\) is 1 \\(\\times\\) 1), \\(\\mathbf{Z}_t = \\mathbf{F}_t^{\\top}\\), \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{0}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{R}_t = r\\) (i.e., \\(\\mathbf{R}_t\\) is 1 \\(\\times\\) 1).

We begin by loading the data set (which is in the MARSS package). The data set has 3 columns for 1) the year the salmon smolts migrated to the ocean (year), 2) logit-transformed survival (logit.s), and 3) the coastal upwelling index for April (CUI.apr). There are 42 years of data (1964–2005). # load the data data(SalmonSurvCUI, package=&quot;MARSS&quot;) # get time indices years &lt;- SalmonSurvCUI[,1] # number of years of data TT &lt;- length(years) # get response variable: logit(survival) dat &lt;- matrix(SalmonSurvCUI[,2],nrow=1) As we have seen in other case studies, standardizing our covariate(s) to have zero-mean and unit-variance can be helpful in model fitting and interpretation. In this case, it’s a good idea because the variance of CUI.apr is orders of magnitude greater than logit.s. # get predictor variable CUI &lt;- SalmonSurvCUI[,3] ## z-score the CUI CUI.z &lt;- matrix((CUI - mean(CUI))/sqrt(var(CUI)), nrow=1) # number of regr params (slope + intercept) m &lt;- dim(CUI.z)[1] + 1 Plots of logit-transformed survival and the \\(z\\)-scored April upwelling index are shown in Figure 9.1. Figure 9.1: Time series of logit-transformed marine survival estimates for Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon (top) and z-scores of the coastal upwelling index at 45N 125W (bottom). The x-axis indicates the year that the salmon smolts entered the ocean. Next, we need to set up the appropriate matrices and vectors for MARSS. Let’s begin with those for the process equation because they are straightforward. # for process eqn B &lt;- diag(m) ## 2x2; Identity U &lt;- matrix(0,nrow=m,ncol=1) ## 2x1; both elements = 0 Q &lt;- matrix(list(0),m,m) ## 2x2; all 0 for now diag(Q) &lt;- c(&quot;q.alpha&quot;,&quot;q.beta&quot;) ## 2x2; diag = (q1,q2) Defining the correct form for the observation model is a little more tricky, however, because of how we model the effect(s) of predictor variables. In a DLM, we need to use \\(\\mathbf{Z}_t\\) (instead of \\(\\mathbf{d}_t\\)) as the matrix of predictor variables that affect \\(\\mathbf{y}_t\\), and we use \\(\\mathbf{x}_t\\) (instead of \\(\\mathbf{D}_t\\)) as the regression parameters. Therefore, we need to set \\(\\mathbf{Z}_t\\) equal to an \\(n\\times m\\times T\\) array, where \\(n\\) is the number of response variables (= 1; \\(y_t\\) is univariate), \\(m\\) is the number of regression parameters (= intercept + slope = 2), and \\(T\\) is the length of the time series (= 42). # for observation eqn Z &lt;- array(NA, c(1,m,TT)) ## NxMxT; empty for now Z[1,1,] &lt;- rep(1,TT) ## Nx1; 1&#39;s for intercept Z[1,2,] &lt;- CUI.z ## Nx1; predictor variable A &lt;- matrix(0) ## 1x1; scalar = 0 R &lt;- matrix(&quot;r&quot;) ## 1x1; scalar = r Lastly, we need to define our lists of initial starting values and model matrices/vectors. # only need starting values for regr parameters inits.list &lt;- list(x0=matrix(c(0, 0), nrow=m)) # list of model matrices &amp; vectors mod.list &lt;- list(B=B, U=U, Q=Q, Z=Z, A=A, R=R) And now we can fit our DLM with MARSS. # fit univariate DLM dlm1 &lt;- MARSS(dat, inits=inits.list, model=mod.list) Success! abstol and log-log tests passed at 115 iterations.

Time series of the estimated intercept and slope are shown in Figure 9.2. It appears as though the intercept is much more dynamic than the slope, as indicated by a much larger estimate of process variance for the former (Q.q1). In fact, although the effect of April upwelling appears to be increasing over time, it doesn’t really become important as a predictor variable until about 1990 when the approximate 95% confidence interval for the slope no longer overlaps zero.

This is also called the one-step ahead forecast (or prediction) of the observation. 9.8.1 Estimate of the regression parameters For step 1, we want to compute the distribution of the regression parameters at time \\(t\\) conditioned on the data up to time \\(t-1\\), also known as the one-step ahead forecasts of the regression parameters. Let’s denote \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t-1}\\) conditioned on \\(y_{1:t-1}\\) as \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t-1|t-1}\\) and denote \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t}\\) conditioned on \\(y_{1:t-1}\\) as \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1}\\). We will start by defining the distribution of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t}\\) as follows \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.24} \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t} \\sim \\text{MVN}(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_t,\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}_t) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_t = \\text{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t})\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\\Lambda}_t = \\text{Var}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t})\\).

This is called the one-step ahead prediction for the observation at time \\(t\\). We will denote the prediction of \\(y\\) as \\(\\hat{y}\\) and we want to compute its distribution (mean and variance). We do this using the equation for \\(y_t\\) but substituting the expected value of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1}\\) for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_t\\). \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.28} \\hat{y}_{t|t-1} = \\mathbf{F}^{\\top}_{t} \\text{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1}) + e_{t} ~ \\text{with} ~ e_{t} \\sim \\text{N}(0, r) \\\\ \\end{equation}\\] Our prediction of \\(y\\) at \\(t\\) has a normal distribution with mean (expected value) and variance.

Thus to produce the predictions, all we need to do is run our DLM state-space model through a Kalman filter to get \\(\\text{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1})\\) and \\(\\text{Var}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1})\\) and then use Equation (9.29) to compute the mean prediction and Equation (9.30) to compute its variance. The Kalman filter will need \\(\\mathbf{F}_t\\), \\(\\mathbf{G}_t\\) and estimates of \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and \\(r\\). The latter are calculated by fitting the DLM to the data \\(y_{1:t}\\), using for example the MARSS() function. Let’s see an example with the salmon survival DLM. We will use the Kalman filter function in the MARSS package and the DLM fit from MARSS(). 9.8.4 Forecasting salmon survival Scheuerell and Williams (2005) were interested in how well upwelling could be used to actually forecast expected survival of salmon, so let’s look at how well our model does in that context. To do so, we need the predictive distribution for the survival at time \\(t\\) given the upwelling at time \\(t\\) and the predicted regression parameters at \\(t\\). In the salmon survival DLM, the \\(\\mathbf{G}_t\\) matrix is the identity matrix, thus the mean and variance of the one-step ahead predictive distribution for the observation at time \\(t\\) reduces to (from Equations (9.29) and (9.30)) \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.31} \\text{E}(\\hat{y}_{t|t-1}) = \\mathbf{F}^{\\top}_{t} \\text{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1}) \\\\ \\text{Var}(\\hat{y}_{t|t-1}) = \\mathbf{F}^{\\top}_{t} \\text{Var}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1}) \\mathbf{F}_{t} + \\hat{r} \\end{equation}\\] where \\[ \\mathbf{F}_{t}=\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ f_{t}\\end{bmatrix} \\] and \\(f_{t}\\) is the upwelling index at \\(t+1\\). \\(\\hat{r}\\) is the estimated observation variance from our model fit. 9.8.5 Forecasting using MARSS Working from Equation (9.31), we can compute the expected value of the forecast at time \\(t\\) and its variance using the Kalman filter. For the expectation, we need \\(\\mathbf{F}_{t}^\\top\\text{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1})\\). \\(\\mathbf{F}_t^\\top\\) is called \\(\\mathbf{Z}_t\\) in MARSS notation. The one-step ahead forecasts of the regression parameters at time \\(t\\), the \\(\\text{E}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1})\\), are calculated as part of the Kalman filter algorithm—they are termed \\(\\tilde{x}_t^{t-1}\\) in MARSS notation and stored as xtt1 in the list produced by the MARSSkfss() Kalman filter function. Using the Z defined in 9.6, we compute the mean forecast as follows: # get list of Kalman filter output kf.out &lt;- MARSSkfss(dlm1) ## forecasts of regr parameters; 2xT matrix eta &lt;- kf.out$xtt1 ## ts of E(forecasts) fore.mean &lt;- vector() for(t in 1:TT) { fore.mean[t] &lt;- Z[,,t] %*% eta[,t,drop=FALSE] } For the variance of the forecasts, we need \\(\\mathbf{F}^{\\top}_{t} \\text{Var}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1}) \\mathbf{F}_{t} + \\hat{r}\\). As with the mean, \\(\\mathbf{F}^\\top_t \\equiv \\mathbf{Z}_t\\). The variances of the one-step ahead forecasts of the regression parameters at time \\(t\\), \\(\\text{Var}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{t|t-1})\\), are also calculated as part of the Kalman filter algorithm—they are stored as Vtt1 in the list produced by the MARSSkfss() function. Lastly, the observation variance \\(\\hat{r}\\) was estimated when we fit the DLM to the data using MARSS() and can be extracted from the dlm1 fit. Putting this together, we can compute the forecast variance: # variance of regr parameters; 1x2xT array Phi &lt;- kf.out$Vtt1 ## obs variance; 1x1 matrix R.est &lt;- coef(dlm1, type=&quot;matrix&quot;)$R ## ts of Var(forecasts) fore.var &lt;- vector() for(t in 1:TT) { tZ &lt;- matrix(Z[,,t],m,1) ## transpose of Z fore.var[t] &lt;- Z[,,t] %*% Phi[,,t] %*% tZ + R.est } Plots of the model mean forecasts with their estimated uncertainty are shown in Figure 9.3. Nearly all of the observed values fell within the approximate prediction interval. Notice that we have a forecasted value for the first year of the time series (1964), which may seem at odds with our notion of forecasting at time \\(t\\) based on data available only through time \\(t-1\\). In this case, however, MARSS is actually estimating the states at \\(t=0\\) (\\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0\\)), which allows us to compute a forecast for the first time point. Figure 9.3: Time series of logit-transformed survival data (blue dots) and model mean forecasts (thick line). Thin lines denote the approximate 95% prediction intervals. Although our model forecasts look reasonable in logit-space, it is worthwhile to examine how well they look when the survival data and forecasts are back-transformed onto the interval [0,1] (Figure 9.4). In that case, the accuracy does not seem to be affected, but the precision appears much worse, especially during the early and late portions of the time series when survival is changing rapidly. Figure 9.4: Time series of survival data (blue dots) and model mean forecasts (thick line). Thin lines denote the approximate 95% prediction intervals. Notice that we passed the DLM fit to all the data to MARSSkfss(). This meant that the Kalman filter used estimates of \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and \\(r\\) using all the data in the xtt1 and Vtt1 calculations. Thus our predictions at time \\(t\\) are not entirely based on only data up to time \\(t-1\\) since the \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and \\(r\\) estimates were from all the data from 1964 to 2005. "],

We can formally test whether the mean of the innovations is significantly different from 0 by using a one-sample \\(t\\)-test. based on a null hypothesis of \\(\\,\\text{E}(e_t)=0\\).

To do so, researchers commonly use a Ricker model because of its relatively simple form, such that the number of recruits (offspring) born in year \\(t\\) (\\(R_t\\)) from the number of spawners (parents) (\\(S_t\\)) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.32} R_t = a S_t e^{-b S + v_t}. \\end{equation}\\] The parameter \\(a\\) determines the maximum reproductive rate in the absence of any density-dependent effects (the slope of the curve at the origin), \\(b\\) is the strength of density dependence, and \\(v_t \\sim N(0,\\sigma)\\). In practice, the model is typically log-transformed so as to make it linear with respect to the predictor variable \\(S_t\\), such that \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{9.33} \\text{log}(R_t) &amp;= \\text{log}(a) + \\text{log}(S_t) -b S_t + v_t \\\\ \\text{log}(R_t) - \\text{log}(S_t) &amp;= \\text{log}(a) -b S_t + v_t \\\\ \\text{log}(R_t/S_t) &amp;= \\text{log}(a) - b S_t + v_t. \\end{align}\\] Substituting \\(y_t = \\text{log}(R_t/S_t)\\), \\(x_t = S_t\\), and \\(\\alpha = \\text{log}(a)\\) yields a simple linear regression model with intercept \\(\\alpha\\) and slope \\(b\\). Unfortunately, however, residuals from this simple model typically show high-autocorrelation due to common environmental conditions that affect overlapping generations. Therefore, to correct for this and allow for an index of stock productivity that controls for any density-dependent effects, the model may be re-written as \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{9.34} \\text{log}(R_t/S_t) &amp;= \\alpha_t - b S_t + v_t, \\\\ \\alpha_t &amp;= \\alpha_{t-1} + w_t, \\end{align}\\] and \\(w_t \\sim N(0,q)\\). By treating the brood-year specific productivity as a random walk, we allow it to vary, but in an autocorrelated manner so that consecutive years are not independent from one another. More recently, interest has grown in using covariates (\\(e.g.\\), sea-surface temperature) to explain the interannual variability in productivity. In that case, we can can write the model as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{9.35} \\text{log}(R_t/S_t) = \\alpha + \\delta_t X_t - b S_t + v_t. \\end{equation}\\] In this case we are estimating some base-level productivity (\\(\\alpha\\)) plus the time-varying effect of some covariate \\(X_t\\) (\\(\\delta_t\\)). 9.10.1 Spawner-recruit data The data come from a large public database begun by Ransom Myers many years ago. If you are interested, you can find lots of time series of spawning-stock, recruitment, and harvest for a variety of fishes around the globe. Here is the website: https://www.ramlegacy.org/ For this exercise, we will use spawner-recruit data for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Kvichak River in SW Alaska that span the years 1952-1989. In addition, we’ll examine the potential effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during the salmon’s first year in the ocean, which is widely believed to be a “bottleneck” to survival.

If instead row 3 was (0.8, 0.1, 0.05), this would make our interpretation of the model fits easier because we could say that green algae followed the first process most closely. The varimax rotation would find the \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) matrix that makes the rows in \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) more like (0.8, 0.1, 0.05) and less like (0.2, 0.2, 0.2). The varimax rotation is easy to compute because R has a built in function for this: varimax(). Interestingly, the function returns the inverse of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), which we need anyway. ## get the estimated ZZ Z_est &lt;- coef(dfa_1, type = &quot;matrix&quot;)$Z ## get the inverse of the rotation matrix H_inv &lt;- varimax(Z_est)$rotmat We can now rotate both \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). ## rotate factor loadings Z_rot = Z_est %*% H_inv ## rotate processes proc_rot = solve(H_inv) %*% dfa_1$states "],

["sec-mssmiss-overview.html", "11.1 Covariates with missing values or observation error", " 11.1 Covariates with missing values or observation error The specific formulation of Equation (8.1) creates restrictions on the assumptions regarding the covariate data. You have to assume that your covariate data has no error, which is probably not true. You cannot have missing values in your covariate data, again unlikely. You cannot combine instrument time series; for example, if you have two temperature recorders with different error rates and biases. Also, what if you have one noisy temperature sensor in the first part of your time series and then you switch to a much better sensor in the second half of your time series? All these problems require pre-analysis massaging of the covariate data, leaving out noisy and gappy covariate data, and making what can feel like arbitrary choices about which covariate time series to include. To circumvent these potential problems and allow more flexibility in how we incorporate covariate data, one can instead treat the covariates as components of an auto-regressive process by including them in both the process and observation models. Beginning with the process equation, we can write \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{x}^{(v)} \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{B}^{(v)} &amp; \\mathbf{C} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathbf{B}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{x}^{(v)} \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix}_{t-1} + \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}^{(v)} \\\\ \\mathbf{u}^{(c)} \\end{bmatrix} + \\mathbf{w}_t,\\\\ \\mathbf{w}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}\\begin{pmatrix}0,\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{Q}^{(v)} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathbf{Q}^{(c)} \\end{bmatrix} \\end{pmatrix} \\end{gathered} \\tag{11.1} \\end{equation}\\] The elements with superscript \\({(v)}\\) are for the \\(k\\) variate states and those with superscript \\({(c)}\\) are for the \\(q\\) covariate states. The dimension of \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(c)}\\) is \\(q \\times 1\\) and \\(q\\) is not necessarily equal to \\(p\\), the number of covariate observation time series in your dataset. Imagine, for example, that you have two temperature sensors and you are combining these data. Then you have two covariate observation time series (\\(p=2\\)) but only one underlying covariate state time series (\\(q=1\\)). The matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is dimension \\(k \\times q\\), and \\(\\mathbf{B}^{(c)}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Q}^{(c)}\\) are dimension \\(q \\times q\\). The dimension of \\(\\mathbf{x}^{(v)}\\) is \\(k \\times 1\\), and \\(\\mathbf{B}^{(v)}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Q}^{(v)}\\) are dimension \\(k \\times k\\). The dimension of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is always denoted \\(m\\). If your process model includes only variates, then \\(k=m\\), but now your process model includes \\(k\\) variates and \\(q\\) covariate states so \\(m=k+q\\). Next, we can write the observation equation in an analogous manner, such that \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{y}^{(v)} \\\\ \\mathbf{y}^{(c)} \\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{Z}^{(v)} &amp; \\mathbf{D} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathbf{Z}^{(c)} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{x}^{(v)} \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^{(c)} \\end{bmatrix}_t + \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{a}^{(v)} \\\\ \\mathbf{a}^{(c)} \\end{bmatrix} + \\mathbf{v}_t,\\\\ \\mathbf{v}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}\\begin{pmatrix}0,\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{R}^{(v)} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathbf{R}^{(c)} \\end{bmatrix} \\end{pmatrix} \\end{gathered} \\tag{11.2} \\end{equation}\\] The dimension of \\(\\mathbf{y}^{(c)}\\) is \\(p \\times 1\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of covariate observation time series in your dataset. The dimension of \\(\\mathbf{y}^{(v)}\\) is \\(l \\times 1\\), where \\(l\\) is the number of variate observation time series in your dataset. The total dimension of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is \\(l+p\\). The matrix \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is dimension \\(l \\times q\\), \\(\\mathbf{Z}^{(c)}\\) is dimension \\(p \\times q\\), and \\(\\mathbf{R}^{(c)}\\) are dimension \\(p \\times p\\). The dimension of \\(\\mathbf{Z}^{(v)}\\) is dimension \\(l \\times k\\), and \\(\\mathbf{R}^{(v)}\\) are dimension \\(l \\times l\\). The \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) matrix would presumably have a number of all zero rows in it, as would the \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) matrix. The covariates that affect the states would often be different than the covariates that affect the observations. For example, mean annual temperature might affect population growth rates for many species while having little or no affect on observability, and turbidity might strongly affect observability in many types of aquatic surveys but have little affect on population growth rate. Our MARSS model with covariates now looks on the surface like a regular MARSS model: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} \\mathbf{x}_t = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{w}_t, \\text{ where } \\mathbf{w}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{Q}) \\\\ \\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{v}_t, \\text{ where } \\mathbf{v}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{R}) \\end{gathered} \\end{equation}\\] with the \\(\\mathbf{x}_t\\), \\(\\mathbf{y}_t\\) and parameter matrices redefined as in Equations (11.1) and (11.2): \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} \\mathbf{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{x}^{(v)}\\\\ \\mathbf{x}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mathbf{B}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{B}^{(v)} &amp; \\mathbf{C} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathbf{B}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mathbf{u}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{u}^{(v)}\\\\ \\mathbf{u}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mathbf{Q}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{Q}^{(v)} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathbf{Q}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\mathbf{y}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{y}^{(v)}\\\\ \\mathbf{y}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mathbf{Z}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{Z}^{(v)} &amp; \\mathbf{D} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathbf{Z}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mathbf{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{a}^{(v)}\\\\ \\mathbf{a}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mathbf{R}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf{R}^{(v)} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathbf{R}^{(c)}\\end{bmatrix} \\end{gathered} \\tag{11.3} \\end{equation}\\] Note \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) are written as block diagonal matrices, but you could allow covariances if that made sense. \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) are column vectors here. We can fit the model (Equation (11.3)) as usual using the MARSS() function. The log-likelihood that is returned by MARSS will include the log-likelihood of the covariates under the covariate state model. If you want only the the log-likelihood of the non-covariate data, you will need to subtract off the log-likelihood of the covariate model: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{gathered} \\mathbf{x}^{(c)}_t = \\mathbf{B}^{(c)}\\mathbf{x}_{t-1}^{(c)} + \\mathbf{u}^{(c)} + \\mathbf{w}_t, \\text{ where } \\mathbf{w}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{Q}^{(c)}) \\\\ \\mathbf{y}^{(c)}_t = \\mathbf{Z}^{(c)}\\mathbf{x}_t^{(c)} + \\mathbf{a}^{(c)} + \\mathbf{v}_t, \\text{ where } \\mathbf{v}_t \\sim \\,\\text{MVN}(0,\\mathbf{R}^{(c)}) \\end{gathered} \\tag{11.4} \\end{equation}\\] An easy way to get this log-likelihood for the covariate data only is use the augmented model (Equation (11.2) with terms defined as in Equation (11.3) but pass in missing values for the non-covariate data. The following code shows how to do this. y.aug = rbind(data,covariates) fit.aug = MARSS(y.aug, model=model.aug) fit.aug is the MLE object that can be passed to MARSSkf(). You need to make a version of this MLE object with the non-covariate data filled with NAs so that you can compute the log-likelihood without the covariates. This needs to be done in the marss element since that is what is used by MARSSkf(). Below is code to do this. fit.cov = fit.aug fit.cov$marss$data[1:dim(data)[1], ] = NA extra.LL = MARSSkf(fit.cov)$logLik Note that when you fit the augmented model, the estimates of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}^{(c)}\\) are affected by the non-covariate data since the model for both the non-covariate and covariate data are estimated simultaneously and are not independent (since the covariate states affect the non-covariates states). If you want the covariate model to be unaffected by the non-covariate data, you can fit the covariate model separately and use the estimates for \\(\\mathbf{B}^{(c)}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Q}^{(c)}\\) as fixed values in your augmented model.

We will use a MARSS model to use all the available data. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ x_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix} b&amp;0&amp;\\dots&amp;0 \\\\ 0&amp;b&amp;\\dots&amp;0 \\\\ \\dots&amp;\\dots&amp;\\dots&amp;\\dots \\\\ 0&amp;0&amp;\\dots&amp;b \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ x_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_{t-1} + \\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ w_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_{t} \\\\ \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ y_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ x_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t + \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ a_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_{t} + \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ v_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t \\tag{11.5} \\end{equation}\\] We will use an unconstrained variance-covariance structure for \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and assume that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is identical and independent and very low (SNOTEL instrument variability). The \\(a_i\\) determine the level of the \\(x_i\\). We need our data to be in rows. We will use reshape2::acast(). dat.feb &lt;- reshape2::acast(swe.feb, Station ~ Year, value.var = &quot;SWE&quot;) We set up the model for MARSS so that it is the same as (11.5). We will fix the measurement error to be small; we could use 0 but the fitting is more stable if we use a small variance instead. When estimating \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), setting the initial value to be at \\(t=1\\) instead of \\(t=0\\) works better. ns &lt;- length(unique(swe.feb$Station)) B &lt;- &quot;diagonal and equal&quot; Q &lt;- &quot;unconstrained&quot; R &lt;- diag(0.01, ns) U &lt;- &quot;zero&quot; A &lt;- &quot;unequal&quot; x0 &lt;- &quot;unequal&quot; mod.list.ar1 = list(B = B, Q = Q, R = R, U = U, x0 = x0, A = A, tinitx = 1) Now we can fit a MARSS model and get estimates of the missing SWEs.

Let’s plot the estimated SWEs for the missing years (Figure 11.3). These estimates use all the information about the correlation with other sites and uses information about correlation with the prior and subsequent years. We will use the tidy() function from the broom package to get the estimated 95% confidence intervals for the estimated states. Notice that for some sites, CIs are low in early years as these sites are highly correlated with site for which there are data. In other sites, the uncertainty is high in early years because the sites with data in those years are not highly correlated. fit &lt;- fit.ar1 d &lt;- augment(fit, interval = &quot;confidence&quot;) d$Year &lt;- d$t + 1980 d$Station &lt;- d$.rownames p &lt;- ggplot(data = d) + geom_line(aes(Year, .fitted)) + geom_ribbon(aes(x = Year, ymin = .conf.low, ymax = .conf.up), linetype = 2, alpha = 0.5) p &lt;- p + geom_point(data = swe.feb, mapping = aes(x = Year, y = SWE)) p + facet_wrap(~Station) + xlab(&quot;&quot;) + ylab(&quot;SWE (demeaned)&quot;) Figure 11.3: Estimated SWEs from the expected value of the states \\(\\hat{x}\\) conditioned on all the data. Note we could also use the expected value of the \\(y\\) conditioned on all the data. If we were using these SWE as covariates in a site specific model, we could then use the estimates as our covariates, however this would not incorporate uncertainty. Alternatively we could use Equation (11.1) and set the parameters for the covariate process to those estimated for our covariate-only model. This approach will incorporate the uncertainty in the SWE estimates in the early years for the sites with no data. Note, we should do some cross-validation (fitting with data left out) to ensure that the estimated SWEs are well-matched to actual measurements. It would probably be best to do ‘leave-three’ out instead of ‘leave-one’ out since the estimates for time \\(t\\) uses information from \\(t-1\\) and \\(t+1\\) (if present). 11.2.1.1 Diagnostics The state residuals have a tendency for negative autocorrelation at lag-1 (Figure 11.4). fit &lt;- fit.ar1 par(mfrow = c(4, 4), mar = c(2, 2, 1, 1)) apply(residuals(fit)$state.residuals[, 1:30], 1, acf) Figure 11.4: State residuals for the AR(1) model. Many stations for autocorrelation at lag-1. 11.2.2 Estimate Feb SWE using only correlation Another approach is to treat the February data as temporally uncorrelated. The two longest time series (Paradise and Olallie Meadows) show minimal autocorrelation so we might decide to just use the correlation across stations for our estimates. In this case, the state of the missing SWE values at time \\(t\\) is the expected value conditioned on all the stations with data at time \\(t\\) given the estimated variance-covariance matrix \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\). We could set this model up as \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ y_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ a_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_{t} + \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ v_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t, \\,\\,\\, \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_1&amp;\\zeta_{1,2}&amp;\\dots&amp;\\zeta_{1,15} \\\\ \\zeta_{2,1}&amp;\\sigma_2&amp;\\dots&amp;\\zeta_{2,15} \\\\ \\dots&amp;\\dots&amp;\\dots&amp;\\dots \\\\ \\zeta_{15,1}&amp;\\zeta_{15,2}&amp;\\dots&amp;\\sigma_{15} \\end{bmatrix} \\tag{11.6} \\end{equation}\\] However the EM algorithm used by MARSS() runs into numerical issues. Instead we will set the model up as follows. Allowing a hidden state observed with small error makes the estimation more stable. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ x_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ w_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_{t}, \\,\\,\\, \\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ w_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_{t} \\sim \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_1&amp;\\zeta_{1,2}&amp;\\dots&amp;\\zeta_{1,15} \\\\ \\zeta_{2,1}&amp;\\sigma_2&amp;\\dots&amp;\\zeta_{2,15} \\\\ \\dots&amp;\\dots&amp;\\dots&amp;\\dots \\\\ \\zeta_{15,1}&amp;\\zeta_{15,2}&amp;\\dots&amp;\\sigma_{15} \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ y_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ x_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t + \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ a_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_{t} + \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\dots \\\\ v_{15} \\end{bmatrix}_t, \\,\\,\\, \\begin{bmatrix} 0.01&amp;0&amp;\\dots&amp;0 \\\\ 0&amp;0.01&amp;\\dots&amp;0 \\\\ \\dots&amp;\\dots&amp;\\dots&amp;\\dots \\\\ 0&amp;0&amp;\\dots&amp;0.01 \\end{bmatrix} \\tag{11.7} \\end{equation}\\] Again \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is the mean level in the time series.

["sec-jags-lr-no-covariates.html", "12.2 Linear regression with no covariates", " 12.2 Linear regression with no covariates We will start with the simplest time series model possible: linear regression with only an intercept, so that the predicted values of all observations are the same. There are several ways we can write this equation. First, the predicted values can be written as \\(E[{y}_{t}] = \\mu\\). Assuming that the residuals are normally distributed, the model linking our predictions to observed data are written as \\[\\begin{equation} y_t = \\mu + e_t, e_t \\sim \\,\\text{N}(0,\\sigma^2) \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation}\\] An equivalent way to think about this model is that instead of the residuals as normally distributed with mean zero, we can think of the data \\(y\\) as being normally distributed with a mean of the intercept, and the same residual standard deviation: \\[\\begin{equation} y \\sim \\,\\text{N}(E[y_t],\\sigma^2) \\tag{12.2} \\end{equation}\\] Remember that in linear regression models, the residual error is interpreted as independent and identically distributed observation error. To run the JAGS model, we will need to start by writing the model in JAGS notation. For our linear regression model, one way to construct the model is # 1. LINEAR REGRESSION with no covariates # no covariates, so intercept only. The parameters are # mean &#39;mu&#39; and precision/variance parameter &#39;tau.obs&#39; model.loc=&quot;lm_intercept.txt&quot; # name of the txt file jagsscript = cat(&quot; model { # priors on parameters mu ~ dnorm(0, 0.01); # mean = 0, sd = 1/sqrt(0.01) tau.obs ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001); # This is inverse gamma sd.obs &lt;- 1/sqrt(tau.obs); # sd is treated as derived parameter for(i in 1:N) { Y[i] ~ dnorm(mu, tau.obs); } } &quot;,file=model.loc) A couple things to notice: JAGS is not vectorized so we need to use for loops (instead of matrix multiplication) and the dnorm notation means that we assume that value (on the left) is normally distributed around a particular mean with a particular precision (1 over the square root of the variance). The model can briefly be summarized as follows: there are 2 parameters in the model (the mean and variance of the observation error). JAGS is a bit funny in that instead of giving a normal distribution the standard deviation or variance, you pass in the precision (1/variance), so our prior on \\(\\mu\\) is pretty vague. The precision receives a gamma prior, which is equivalent to the variance receiving an inverse gamma prior (fairly common for standard Bayesian regression models). We will treat the standard deviation as derived (if we know the variance or precision, which we are estimating, we automatically know the standard deviation). Finally, we write a model for the data \\(y_t\\) (Y[i]). Again we use the dnorm distribution to say that the data are normally distributed (equivalent to our likelihood). The function from the R2jags package that we actually use to run the model is jags(). There is a parallel version of the function called jags.parallel() which is useful for larger, more complex models. The details of both can be found with ?jags or ?jags.parallel. To actually run the model, we need to create several new objects, representing (1) a list of data that we will pass to JAGS, (2) a vector of parameters that we want to monitor in JAGS and have returned back to R, and (3) the name of our text file that contains the JAGS model we wrote above. With those three things, we can call the jags() function. jags.data = list(&quot;Y&quot;=Wind,&quot;N&quot;=N) # named list of inputs jags.params=c(&quot;sd.obs&quot;,&quot;mu&quot;) # parameters to be monitored mod_lm_intercept = jags(jags.data, parameters.to.save=jags.params, model.file=model.loc, n.chains = 3, n.burnin=5000, n.thin=1, n.iter=10000, DIC=TRUE) module glm loaded Notice that the jags() function contains a number of other important arguments. In general, larger is better for all arguments: we want to run multiple MCMC chains (maybe 3 or more), and have a burn-in of at least 5000. The total number of samples after the burn-in period is n.iter-n.burnin, which in this case is 5000 samples. Because we are doing this with 3 MCMC chains, and the thinning rate equals 1 (meaning we are saving every sample), we will retain a total of 1500 posterior samples for each parameter. The saved object storing our model diagnostics can be accessed directly, and includes some useful summary output. mod_lm_intercept Inference for Bugs model at &quot;lm_intercept.txt&quot;, fit using jags, 3 chains, each with 10000 iterations (first 5000 discarded) n.sims = 15000 iterations saved mu.vect sd.vect 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% Rhat mu 9.948 0.287 9.380 9.758 9.949 10.138 10.515 1.001 sd.obs 3.540 0.203 3.172 3.400 3.529 3.669 3.967 1.001 deviance 820.546 2.030 818.590 819.115 819.919 821.298 825.947 1.001 n.eff mu 5200 sd.obs 15000 deviance 15000 For each parameter, n.eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor (at convergence, Rhat=1).

The last 2 columns in the summary contain Rhat (which we want to be close to 1.0), and neff (the effective sample size of each set of posterior draws). To examine the output more closely, we can pull all of the results directly into R, attach.jags(mod_lm_intercept) The following object is masked _by_ .GlobalEnv: mu Attaching the R2jags object allows us to work with the named parameters directly in R.

Finally, we can run some useful diagnostics from the coda package on this model output. We have written a small function to make the creation of mcmc lists (an argument required for many of the diagnostics). The function createMcmcList = function(jagsmodel) { McmcArray = as.array(jagsmodel$BUGSoutput$sims.array) McmcList = vector(&quot;list&quot;,length=dim(McmcArray)[2]) for(i in 1:length(McmcList)) McmcList[[i]] = as.mcmc(McmcArray[,i,]) McmcList = mcmc.list(McmcList) return(McmcList) } Creating the MCMC list preserves the random samples generated from each chain and allows you to extract the samples for a given parameter (such as \\(\\mu\\)) from any chain you want. To extract \\(\\mu\\) from the first chain, for example, you could use the following code. Because createMcmcList() returns a list of mcmc objects, we can summarize and plot these directly.

We are going to modify this to model autocorrelated errors. Autocorrelated errors are widely used in ecology and other fields – for a greater discussion, see Morris and Doak (2002) Quantitative Conservation Biology. To make the deviations autocorrelated, we start by defining the deviation in the first time step, \\(e_1 = Y_1 - u\\). The expectation of \\(y_t\\) in each time step is then written as \\[\\begin{equation} E[y_t] = \\mu + \\phi * e_{t-1} \\tag{12.3} \\end{equation}\\] In addition to affecting the expectation, the correlation parameter \\(\\phi\\) also affects the variance of the errors, so that \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma^2 = \\psi^2\\left( 1-\\phi^2 \\right) \\tag{12.4} \\end{equation}\\] Like in our first model, we assume that the data follow a normal likelihood (or equivalently that the residuals are normally distributed), \\({y_t} = E[{y_t}] + {e}_{t}\\), or \\({y_t} \\sim \\,\\text{N}(E[y_t], \\sigma^2)\\). Thus, it is possible to express the subsequent deviations as \\(e_t = y_t - E[y_t]\\), or equivalently as \\(e_t = y_t - \\mu -\\phi \\times e_{t-1}\\). The JAGS script for this model is: # 2.

We use the notation \\({x_t}\\) to denote the latent state or state of nature (which is unobserved) at time \\(t\\) and \\({y_t}\\) to denote the observed data. For introductory purposes, we’ll make the process model autoregressive (similar to our AR(1) model), \\[x_{t} = \\phi x_{t-1} + e_{t}, e_{t} \\sim N(0,q)\\] For the process model, there are a number of ways to parameterize the first ‘state’, and we’ll talk about this more in the class, but for the sake of this model, we’ll place a vague weakly informative prior on \\(x_1\\), \\(x_1 \\sim N(0, 0.01)\\).Second, we need to construct an observation model linking the estimate unseen states of nature \\(x_t\\) to the data \\(y_t\\). For simplicitly, we’ll assume that the observation errors are indepdendent and identically distributed, with no observation component. Mathematically, this model is \\[Y_t \\sim N(x_t, r)\\] In the two above models, we’ll refer to \\(q\\) as the standard deviation of the process variance and \\(r\\) as the standard deviation of the observation error variance We can fit the state-space AR(1) and random walk models using the fit_stan() function: ss_ar &lt;- atsar::fit_stan(y = Temp, est_drift=FALSE, model_name = &quot;ss_ar&quot;) ss_rw &lt;- atsar::fit_stan(y = Temp, est_drift=FALSE, model_name = &quot;ss_rw&quot;) "],

["sec-stan-problems.html", "13.8 Problems", " 13.8 Problems By adapting the code in Section 13.1, fit a regression model that includes the intercept and a slope, modeling the effect of Wind. What is the mean wind effect you estimate? Using the results from the linear regression model fit with no burn-in (Section 13.1.1), calculate the ACF of the beta time series using acf(). Would thinning more be appropriate? How much? Using the fit of the random walk model to the temperature data (Section 13.3), plot the predicted values (states) and 95% CIs. To see the effect of this increased flexibility in estimating the autocorrelation, make a plot of the predictions from the AR(1) model (Section 13.4 and the RW model (13.3). Fit the univariate state-space model (Section 13.5) with and without the autoregressive parameter \\(\\phi\\) and compare the estimated process and observation error variances. Recall that AR(1) without the \\(\\phi\\) parameter is a random walk. "],
