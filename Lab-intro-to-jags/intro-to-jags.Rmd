# JAGS for Bayesian time series analysis  {#chap-jags}
\chaptermark{JAGS}

In this lab, we will work through using Bayesian methods to estimate parameters in time series models. There are a variety of software tools to do time series analysis using Bayesian methods. R lists a number of packages available on the R Cran [TimeSeries](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html) task view.  

Software to implement more complicated models is also available, and many of you are probably familiar with these options (AD Model Builder and Template Model Builder, WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, JAGS, Stan, to name a few). In this chapter, we will show you how to write state-space models in JAGS and fit these models.  

After updating to the latest version of R, install JAGS for your operating platform using the instructions [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/).  Click on JAGS, then the most recent folder, then the platform of your machine.  You will also need the **coda**, **rjags** and **R2jags** packages.
```{r jags-loadpackages, results='hide', message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
library(coda)
library(rjags)
library(R2jags)
```

## The airquality dataset {#sec-jags-dataset}

For data for this lab, we will include a dataset on air quality in New York. We will load the data and create a couple new variables for future use. For the majority of our models, we are going to treat wind speed as the response variable for our time series models. 

```{r jags-loaddata, echo=TRUE, results='hide', eval=TRUE}
data(airquality, package = "datasets")
Wind <- airquality$Wind # wind speed
Temp <- airquality$Temp # air temperature
N <- dim(airquality)[1] # number of data points
```


## Linear regression with no covariates {#sec-jags-lr-no-covariates}

We will start with the simplest time series model possible: linear regression with only an intercept, so that the predicted values of all observations are the same. We will write the model as follows. $E[{y}_{t}] = x_t$ where $x_t = u$. Our model is
\begin{equation}
x_t = u \\
y_t = x_t + e_t, e_t \sim \N(0, r)
(\#eq:jags-obs-eqn)
\end{equation}
An equivalent way to think about this model is 
\begin{equation}
y_t \sim \N(E[y_t], r)
(\#eq:jags-obs-eqn2)
\end{equation}
where $E[y_t]=x_t=u$.
Remember that in linear regression models, the residual error is interpreted as independent and identically distributed observation error.

To run the JAGS model, we will need to start by writing the model in JAGS notation. Note we are writing the JAGS code like this to build up to state-space models. You could write this much simpler for this model. For our linear regression model, we can construct the model as

```{r jags-lr1, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
# LINEAR REGRESSION with no covariates
# intercept only. The parameters are
# mean 'mu' and precision/variance parameter 'tau.obs'

model.loc <- "lm_intercept.txt" # name of the txt file
jagsscript <- cat("
model {  
   # priors on parameters
   u ~ dnorm(0, 0.01);
   tau.r ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001); # This is inverse gamma
   sd.r <- 1/sqrt(tau.r); # sd is treated as derived parameter
   for(i in 1:N) {
      X[i] <- u
      EY[i] <- X[i];
      Y[i] ~ dnorm(EY[i], tau.r); 
   }
}  
", file = model.loc)
```
```{r clean1, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
removefiles <- c(removefiles, model.loc)
```

A couple things to notice: JAGS is not vectorized so we need to use for loops (instead of matrix multiplication) and the `dnorm()` notation means that we assume that the value on the left is normally distributed around a particular mean with a particular precision (1 over the square root of the variance). `sd.r` is $\sqrt{r}$.

The model can briefly be summarized as follows: there are two parameters in the model (the mean and $r$, the variance of the observation error). In JAGS instead of specifying the normal distribution with the variance or the standard deviation (sd), you pass in the precision (1/sd). Thus `dnorm(0, 0.01)`, our prior on $\mu$, is pretty vague. The precision receives a gamma prior, which is equivalent to the variance receiving an inverse gamma prior (fairly common for standard Bayesian regression models). Finally, we write a model for the data $y_t$ (`Y[i]`). Again we use the `dnorm()` distribution to say that the data are normally distributed (equivalent to our likelihood). 

The function from the **R2jags** package that we use to run the model is `jags()`. There is a parallel version of the function called `jags.parallel()` which is useful for larger, more complex models. The details of both can be found with `?jags` or `?jags.parallel`.

To run the model, we need to create several new objects, representing (1) a list of data that we will pass to JAGS, (2) a vector of parameters that we want to monitor and have returned back to R, and (3) the name of our text file that contains the JAGS model we wrote above. With those three things, we can call the `jags()` function. 

```{r jags-call-fun1, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
jags.data <- list("Y" = Wind, "N" = N) # named list of inputs
jags.params <- c("sd.r", "u") # parameters to be monitored
mod_lm_intercept <- R2jags::jags(jags.data,
  parameters.to.save = jags.params,
  model.file = model.loc, n.chains = 3, n.burnin = 5000,
  n.thin = 1, n.iter = 10000, DIC = TRUE
)
```

Notice that the `jags()` function contains a number of other important arguments. In general, larger is better for all arguments: we want to run multiple MCMC chains (maybe 3 or more), and have a burn-in of at least 5000. The total number of samples after the burn-in period is n.iter-n.burnin, which in this case is 5000 samples. Because we are doing this with 3 MCMC chains, and the thinning rate equals 1 (meaning we are saving every sample), we will retain a total of 1500 posterior samples for each parameter.  

The saved object storing our model diagnostics can be accessed directly, and includes some useful summary output.
```{r jags-lm1-mod}
mod_lm_intercept
```

The last two columns in the summary contain `Rhat` (which we want to be close to 1.0), and `neff` (the effective sample size of each set of posterior draws). To examine the output more closely, we can pull all of the results directly into R,

```{r jags-lm1-attach}
R2jags::attach.jags(mod_lm_intercept)
```

Attaching the **R2jags** object allows us to work with the named parameters directly in R. For example, we could make a histogram of the posterior distributions of the parameters `mu` and `sd.obs` with the following code,

```{r jags-plot-lm1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.show='hide'}
# Now we can make plots of posterior values
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(u, 40, col = "grey", xlab = "u", main = "")
hist(sd.r, 40, col = "grey", xlab = expression(sigma[r]), main = "")
```

(ref:jags-plot-hist-post) Plot of the posteriors for the linear regression model.

```{r jags-plot-hist-post, fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.cap='(ref:jags-plot-hist-post)'}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(u, 40, col = "grey", xlab = "u", main = "")
hist(sd.r, 40, col = "grey", xlab = expression(sigma[r]), main = "")
```
 

Finally, we can run some useful diagnostics from the **coda** package on this model output. We have written a small function to make the creation of a MCMC list (an argument required for many of the diagnostics). The function is

```{r jags-lm1-mcmclist-func, cache=TRUE}
createMcmcList <- function(jagsmodel) {
  McmcArray <- as.array(jagsmodel$BUGSoutput$sims.array)
  McmcList <- vector("list", length = dim(McmcArray)[2])
  for (i in 1:length(McmcList)) McmcList[[i]] <- as.mcmc(McmcArray[, i, ])
  McmcList <- mcmc.list(McmcList)
  return(McmcList)
}
```

Creating the  MCMC list preserves the random samples generated from each chain and allows you to extract the samples for a given parameter (such as $\mu$) from any chain you want. To extract $\mu$ from the first chain, for example, you could use the following code. Because `createMcmcList()` returns a list of **mcmc** objects, we can summarize and plot these directly. Figure \@ref(fig:jags-plot-myList) shows the plot from `plot(myList[[1]])`.

```{r jags-make-myList}
myList <- createMcmcList(mod_lm_intercept)
summary(myList[[1]])
plot(myList[[1]])
```

(ref:jags-plot-myList) Plot of an object output from $\texttt{creatMcmcList}$.

```{r jags-plot-myList,fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.cap='(ref:jags-plot-myList)'}
plot(myList[[1]])
```
 
For more quantitative diagnostics of MCMC convergence, we can rely on the **coda** package in R. There
are several useful statistics available, including the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic (for one or several chains), autocorrelation diagnostics (similar to the ACF you calculated above), the Geweke diagnostic, and Heidelberger-Welch test of stationarity. 

```{r jags-coda, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(coda)
gelmanDiags <- coda::gelman.diag(createMcmcList(mod_lm_intercept), multivariate = FALSE)
autocorDiags <- coda::autocorr.diag(createMcmcList(mod_lm_intercept))
gewekeDiags <- coda::geweke.diag(createMcmcList(mod_lm_intercept))
heidelDiags <- coda::heidel.diag(createMcmcList(mod_lm_intercept))
```

### Linear regression with covariates {#sec-jags-covariates}

We can introduce `Temp` as the covariate explaining our response variable `Wind`. Note that to include the covariate, we (1) modify the JAGS script to include a new coefficient---in this case `C`, (2) update the predictive equation to include the effects of the new covariate, and (3) we include the new covariate in our named data list. 

\begin{equation}
x_t = u + C\,c_t\\
y_t = x_t + e_t, e_t \sim \N(0, r)
(\#eq:jags-obs-eqn)
\end{equation}

```{r jags-cov, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
# 1. LINEAR REGRESSION with covariates

model.loc <- ("lm.txt")
jagsscript <- cat("
model {  
   u ~ dnorm(0, 0.01); 
   C ~ dnorm(0,0.01);
   tau.r ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001); 
   sd.r <- 1/sqrt(tau.r); 
   
   for(i in 1:N) {
      X[i] <- u + C*c[i];
      EY[i] <- X[i]
      Y[i] ~ dnorm(EY[i], tau.r);
   }
}  
", file = model.loc)

jags.data <- list("Y" = Wind, "N" = N, "c" = Temp)
jags.params <- c("sd.r", "EY", "u", "C")
mod_lm <- R2jags::jags(jags.data,
  parameters.to.save = jags.params,
  model.file = model.loc, n.chains = 3, n.burnin = 5000,
  n.thin = 1, n.iter = 10000, DIC = TRUE
)
```
```{r clean6, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
removefiles <- c(removefiles, model.loc)
```



For some models, we may be interested in examining the posterior fits to data. You can make this plot yourself, but we have also put together a simple function whose arguments are one of our fitted models and the raw data. The function is: 

```{r jags-lm1ar-plot-func, results='hide'}
plotModelOutput <- function(jagsmodel, Y) {
  # attach the model
  R2jags::attach.jags(jagsmodel)
  x <- seq(1, length(Y))
  summaryPredictions <- cbind(
    apply(EY, 2, quantile, 0.025), apply(EY, 2, mean),
    apply(EY, 2, quantile, 0.975)
  )
  plot(Y,
    col = "white", ylim = c(min(c(Y, summaryPredictions)), max(c(Y, summaryPredictions))),
    xlab = "", ylab = "95% CIs of predictions and data", main = paste(
      "JAGS results:",
      jagsmodel$model.file
    )
  )
  polygon(c(x, rev(x)), c(summaryPredictions[, 1], rev(summaryPredictions[, 3])),
    col = "grey70", border = NA
  )
  lines(summaryPredictions[, 2])
  points(Y)
}
```

We can use the function to plot the predicted posterior mean with 95\% CIs, as well as the raw data. For example, try
```{r jags-lm1ar-plot, results='hide', eval=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
plotModelOutput(mod_lm, Wind)
```


(ref:jags-lm1ar-plot1) Predicted posterior mean with 95\% CIs 

```{r jags-lm1ar-plot1, fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.cap='(ref:jags-lm1ar-plot1)'}
plotModelOutput(mod_lm, Wind)
```
 
## Random walk time series model {#sec-jags-rw}

All of the previous three models can be interpreted as observation error models. Switching gears, we can alternatively model error in the state of nature, creating process error models. A simple process error model that many of you may have seen before is the random walk model. In this model, the assumption is that the true state of nature (or latent states) are measured perfectly. Thus, all uncertainty is originating from process variation (for ecological problems, this is often interpreted as environmental variation). For this simple model, we will assume that our process of interest (in this case, daily wind speed) exhibits no daily trend, but behaves as a random walk. 

\begin{equation}
E[y_t] = y_{t-1} + e_{t-1}
(\#eq:jags-obs-eqn-rw)
\end{equation}

And the $e_t \sim \N(0, q)$. The JAGS random walk model and R script to run it is below:

```{r jags-ar1, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
# RANDOM WALK no covariates.
# we will call the precision tau.pro
# Note that we have to define predY[1]

model.loc <- ("rw_intercept.txt")
jagsscript <- cat("
model {  
   mu ~ dnorm(0, 0.01); 
   tau.pro ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001); 
   sd.pro <- 1/sqrt(tau.pro);

   predY[1] <- mu; # initial value
   for(i in 2:N) {
      predY[i] <- Y[i-1]; 
      Y[i] ~ dnorm(predY[i], tau.pro);
   }
}  
", file = model.loc)

jags.data <- list("Y" = Wind, "N" = N)
jags.params <- c("sd.pro", "predY", "mu")
mod_rw_intercept <- jags(jags.data,
  parameters.to.save = jags.params, model.file = model.loc,
  n.chains = 3, n.burnin = 5000, n.thin = 1, n.iter = 10000, DIC = TRUE
)
```
```{r clean3, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
removefiles <- c(removefiles, model.loc)
```
`sd.pro` is $\sqrt{q}$

## Autoregressive AR(1) time series models {#sec-jags-ar1}

A variation of the random walk model described previously is the autoregressive time series model of order 1, AR(1). This model introduces a coefficient, which we will call $\phi$. The parameter $\phi$ controls the degree to which the random walk reverts to the mean---when $\phi = 1$, the model is identical to the random walk, but at smaller values, the model will revert back to the mean (which in this case is zero). Also, $\phi$ can take on negative values, which we will discuss more in future lectures. The math to describe the AR(1) time series model is:

\begin{equation}
E[y_t] = \phi * y_{t-1} + e_{t-1}
(\#eq:jags-obs-eqn-ar1)
\end{equation}

The JAGS random walk model to run the AR(1) model is below:

```{r jags-ar1est, echo=TRUE, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
# AR(1) MODEL WITH AND ESTIMATED AR COEFFICIENT
# We're introducting a new AR coefficient 'phi', so the model is
# y[t] ~ N(mu + phi*y[n-1], q)

model.loc <- ("ar1_intercept.txt")
jagsscript <- cat("
model {  
   mu ~ dnorm(0, 0.01); 
   tau.pro ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001); 
   sd.pro <- 1/sqrt(tau.pro); 
   phi ~ dnorm(0, 1); 
   
   predY[1] <- Y[1];
   for(i in 2:N) {
      predY[i] <- mu + phi * Y[i-1]; 
      Y[i] ~ dnorm(predY[i], tau.pro);
   }
}  
", file = model.loc)

jags.data <- list("Y" = Wind, "N" = N)
jags.params <- c("sd.pro", "predY", "mu", "phi")
mod_ar1_intercept <- jags(jags.data,
  parameters.to.save = jags.params,
  model.file = model.loc, n.chains = 3, n.burnin = 5000, n.thin = 1,
  n.iter = 10000, DIC = TRUE
)
```
```{r clean4, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
removefiles <- c(removefiles, model.loc)
```


## Univariate state space model {#sec-jags-uss}

At this point, we have fit models with observation or process error, but we have not tried to estimate both simultaneously. We will do so here, and introduce some new notation to describe the process model and observation model. We use the notation $x_t$ to denote the latent state or state of nature (which is unobserved) at time $t$ and $y_t$ to denote the observed data. For introductory purposes, we will make the process, or $x$, model autoregressive (similar to our AR(1) model),

\begin{equation}
x_t = \phi * x_{t-1} + e_t; e_t \sim \N(0,q)
(\#eq:jags-proc-eqn-uss)
\end{equation}

For the process model, there are a number of ways to parameterize the first state ($x_1$). We will place a vague weakly informative prior on $x_1$: $x_1 \sim \N(y_1, \sigma=10)$. Note, because we use $Y_1$, our first data point should not be NA. Second, we need to construct an observation model linking the estimate unseen states of nature $x_t$ to the data $y_t$. For simplicitly, we will assume that the observation errors are indepdendent and identically distributed, with no observation component. Mathematically, this model is 
\begin{equation}
y_t \sim \N(x_t, r)
(\#eq:jags-obs-eqn-uss)
\end{equation}
In the two above models, $q$ is the  process variance and $r$ is the observation error variance. The JAGS code will use the standard deviation (square root) of these.  The code to produce and fit this model is below:

```{r jags-ss1, echo=TRUE, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
# 5. MAKE THE SS MODEL a univariate random walk
# no covariates.

model.loc <- ("ss_model.txt")
jagsscript <- cat("

   tau.obs ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001);
   sd.r <- 1/sqrt(tau.obs); 
   phi ~ dnorm(0,1);
   
   X[1] <- mu;
   predY[1] <- X[1];
   Y[1] ~ dnorm(X[1], tau.obs);

   for(i in 2:N) {
      predX[i] <- phi*X[i-1]; 
      X[i] ~ dnorm(predX[i],tau.pro); # Process variation
      predY[i] <- X[i];
      Y[i] ~ dnorm(X[i], tau.obs); # Observation variation
   }
}  
", file = model.loc)

)
```

## Regression with autocorrelated errors {#sec-jags-regression-with-corr-errors}

```{r jags-lm1ar, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
# LINEAR REGRESSION with autocorrelated errors
# no covariates, so intercept only.

model.loc <- ("lmcor_intercept.txt")
jagsscript <- cat("

   # priors on parameters

   tau.obs ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001);

   phi ~ dunif(-1,1);
   tau.cor <- tau.obs / (1-phi*phi); # Var = sigma2 * (1-rho^2)
   
   epsilon[1] <- Y[1] - mu;
   predY[1] <- mu; # initial value
   for(i in 2:N) {
      X[i] <- phi * X[i-1]; 
      Y[i] ~ dnorm(predY[i], tau.cor);
      epsilon[i] <- (Y[i] - mu) - phi*epsilon[i-1];
   }
}
", file = model.loc)
```
```{r clean2, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
removefiles <- c(removefiles, model.loc)
```

Notice several subtle changes from the simpler first model: (1) we are estimating the autocorrelation parameter $\phi$, which is assigned a Uniform(-1, 1) prior, (2) we model the residual variance as a function of the autocorrelation, and (3) we allow the autocorrelation to affect the predicted values `predY`. One other change we can make is to add `predY` to the list of parameters we want returned to R. 

```{r jags-lm1ar-mod, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
jags.data <- list("Y" = Wind, "N" = N)
jags.params <- c("sd.obs", "predY", "mu", "phi")
mod_lmcor_intercept <- jags(jags.data,
  parameters.to.save = jags.params,
  model.file = model.loc, n.chains = 3, n.burnin = 5000,
  n.thin = 1, n.iter = 10000, DIC = TRUE
)
```

In our first model, the errors were independent in time. We are going to modify this to model autocorrelated errors. To make the deviations autocorrelated, we start by defining the deviation in the first time step, $e_1 = Y_1 - u$. The expectation of $y_t$ in each time step is then written as 

\begin{equation}
E[y_t] = \mu + \phi * e_{t-1}
(\#eq:jags-obs-eqn-lr-ar-err)
\end{equation}

In addition to affecting the expectation, the correlation parameter $\phi$ also affects the variance of the errors, so that 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_r^2 = \psi^2\left( 1-\phi^2 \right)
(\#eq:jags-obs-eqn-lr-ar-err2)
\end{equation}

Like in our first model, we assume that the data follow a normal likelihood (or equivalently that the residuals are normally distributed), $y_t = E[y_t] + e_t$, or $y_t \sim \N(E[y_t], r)$. Thus, it is possible to express the subsequent deviations as $e_t = y_t - E[y_t]$, or equivalently as $e_t = y_t - \mu - \phi e_{t-1}$. The JAGS script for this model is:

```{r jags-lm1ar, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
# LINEAR REGRESSION with autocorrelated errors
# no covariates, so intercept only.

model.loc <- ("lmcor_intercept.txt")
jagsscript <- cat("
model {

   phi ~ dunif(-1,1);
   tau.cor <- tau.obs / (1-phi*phi); # Var = sigma2 * (1-rho^2)
   
   epsilon[1] <- Y[1] - mu;
   predY[1] <- mu; # initial value
   for(i in 2:N) {
      predY[i] <- mu + phi * epsilon[i-1]; 
      Y[i] ~ dnorm(predY[i], tau.cor);

   }

## Poisson observation errors {#sec-jags-poisson}

So far we have used the following observation model $y_t \sim \N(x_t, r)$. We can change this to a poisson observation error model: $y_t \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda_t)$ where $\text{log}(\lambda_t) = x_t$. $x_t$ is our process. Let's start with the simplest model, the linear regression with only and intercept. $x = \mu$ for this model.

## Forecasting with JAGS models {#sec-jags-forecast}

There are a number of different approaches to using Bayesian time series models to perform forecasting. One approach might be to fit a model, and use those posterior distributions to forecast as a secondary step (say within R). A more streamlined approach is to do this within the JAGS code itself. We can take advantage of the fact that JAGS allows you to include NAs in the response variable (but never in the predictors). Let's use the same Wind dataset, and the univariate state-space model described above to forecast three time steps into the future. We can do this by including 3 more NAs in the dataset, and incrementing the variable ```N``` by 3.

```{r jags-cov-forecast, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
jags.data <- list("Y" = c(Wind, NA, NA, NA), "N" = (N + 3))
jags.params <- c("sd.q", "sd.r", "predY", "mu")
model.loc <- ("ss_model.txt")
mod_ss_forecast <- jags(jags.data,
  parameters.to.save = jags.params,
  model.file = model.loc, n.chains = 3, n.burnin = 5000, n.thin = 1,
  n.iter = 10000, DIC = TRUE
)
```

We can inspect the fitted model object, and see that ```predY``` contains the 3 new predictions for the forecasts from this model.

## Problems {#sec-jags-problems}


1. Fit the intercept only model from section \@ref(sec-jags-lr-no-covariates). Set the burn-in to 3, and when the  model completes, plot the time series of the parameter ```mu``` for the first MCMC chain.

    a. Based on your visual inspection, has the MCMC chain convered?
    
    b. What is the ACF of the first MCMC chain?

2. Increase the MCMC burn-in for the model in question 1 to a value that you think is reasonable. After the model has converged, calculate the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic for the fitted model object.

3. Compare the results of the ```plotModelOutput()``` function for the intercept only model from section \@ref(sec-jags-lr-no-covariates). You will to add "predY" to your JAGS model and to the list of parameters to monitor, and re-run the model.

4. Modify the random walk model without drift from section \@ref(sec-jags-rw) to a random walk model with drift. The equation for this model is
\begin{equation*}
E[y_t] = y_{t-1} + \mu + e_{t-1}
\end{equation*}
    where $\mu$ is interpreted as the average daily trend in wind speed. What might be a reasonable prior on $\mu$? 

5. Plot the posterior distribution of $\phi$ for the AR(1) model in section \@ref(sec-jags-ar1).  Can this parameter be well estimated for this dataset?

6. Plot the posteriors for the process and observation variances (not standard deviation) for the univariate state-space model in section \@ref(sec-jags-uss). Which is larger for this dataset?

7. Add the effect of temperature to the AR(1) model in section \@ref(sec-jags-ar1).  Plot the posterior for ```beta``` and compare to the posterior for ```beta``` from the model in section \@ref(sec-jags-covariates).

8. Plot the fitted values from the model in section \@ref(sec-jags-forecast), including the forecasts, with the 95\% credible intervals for each data point.

9. The following is a dataset from the Upper Skagit River (Puget Sound, 1952-2005) on salmon spawners and recruits:
    ```{r jags-hwdata, echo=TRUE}
Spawners <- c(2662, 1806, 1707, 1339, 1686, 2220, 3121, 5028, 9263, 4567, 1850, 3353, 2836, 3961, 4624, 3262, 3898, 3039, 5966, 5931, 7346, 4911, 3116, 3185, 5590, 2485, 2987, 3829, 4921, 2348, 1932, 3151, 2306, 1686, 4584, 2635, 2339, 1454, 3705, 1510, 1331, 942, 884, 666, 1521, 409, 2388, 1043, 3262, 2606, 4866, 1161, 3070, 3320)
Recruits <- c(12741, 15618, 23675, 37710, 62260, 32725, 8659, 28101, 17054, 29885, 33047, 20059, 35192, 11006, 48154, 35829, 46231, 32405, 20782, 21340, 58392, 21553, 27528, 28246, 35163, 15419, 16276, 32946, 11075, 16909, 22359, 8022, 16445, 2912, 17642, 2929, 7554, 3047, 3488, 577, 4511, 1478, 3283, 1633, 8536, 7019, 3947, 2789, 4606, 3545, 4421, 1289, 6416, 3647)
logRS <- log(Recruits / Spawners)
    ```

    a. Fit the following Ricker model to these data using the following linear form of this model with normally distributed errors:   
\begin{equation*}
log(R_t/S_t) = a + b \times S_t + e_t,\text{ where } e_t \sim \N(0,\sigma^2)
\end{equation*}
    You will recognize that this form is exactly the same as linear regression, with independent errors (very similar to the intercept only model of Wind we fit in section \@ref(sec-jags-lr-no-covariates)).

    b. Within the constraints of the Ricker model, think about other ways you might want to treat the errors. The basic model described above has independent errors that are not correlated in time. Approaches to analyzing this dataset might involve

        *  modeling the errors as independent (as described above)
        
        *  modeling the errors as autocorrelated
        
        *  fitting a state-space model, with independent or correlated process errors

    Fit each of these models, and compare their performance (either using their predictive ability, or forecasting ability).
